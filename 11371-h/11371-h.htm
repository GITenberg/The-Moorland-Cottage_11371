      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER I.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">If you take the turn to the left, after you pass the
      lyke-gate at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Combehurst Church, you will come to the wooden bridge over
      the brook; keep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">along the field-path which mounts higher and higher, and,
      in half a mile or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so, you will be in a breezy upland field, almost large
      enough to be called</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a down, where sheep pasture on the short, fine, elastic
      turf. You look down</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on Combehurst and its beautiful church-spire. After the
      field is crossed,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you come to a common, richly colored with the golden gorse
      and the purple</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heather, which in summer-time send out their warm scents
      into the quiet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">air. The swelling waves of the upland make a near horizon
      against the sky;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the line is only broken in one place by a small grove of
      Scotch firs, which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">always look black and shadowed even at mid-day, when all
      the rest of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">landscape seems bathed in sunlight. The lark quivers and
      sings high up in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the air; too high--in too dazzling a region for you to see
      her. Look! she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">drops into sight; but, as if loth to leave the heavenly
      radiance, she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">balances herself and floats in the ether. Now she falls
      suddenly right into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her nest, hidden among the ling, unseen except by the eyes
      of Heaven,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and the small bright insects that run hither and thither on
      the elastic</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">flower-stalks. With something like the sudden drop of the
      lark, the path</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">goes down a green abrupt descent; and in a basin,
      surrounded by the grassy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hills, there stands a dwelling, which is neither cottage
      nor house, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something between the two in size. Nor yet is it a farm,
      though surrounded</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by living things. It is, or rather it was, at the time of
      which I speak,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the dwelling of Mrs. Browne, the widow of the late curate
      of Combehurst.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">There she lived with her faithful old servant and her only
      children, a boy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and girl. They were as secluded in their green hollow as
      the households in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the German forest-tales. Once a week they emerged and
      crossed the common,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">catching on its summit the first sounds of the sweet-toned
      bells, calling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">them to church. Mrs. Browne walked first, holding Edward's
      hand. Old Nancy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">followed with Maggie; but they were all one party, and all
      talked together</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in a subdued and quiet tone, as beseemed the day. They had
      not much to say,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">their lives were too unbroken; for, excepting on Sundays,
      the widow and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her children never went to Combehurst. Most people would
      have thought the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little town a quiet, dreamy place; but to those two
      children if seemed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the world; and after they had crossed the bridge, they each
      clasped more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tightly the hands which they held, and looked shyly up from
      beneath their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">drooped eyelids when spoken to by any of their mother's
      friends. Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Browne was regularly asked by some one to stay to dinner
      after morning</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">church, and as regularly declined, rather to the timid
      children's relief;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">although in the week-days they sometimes spoke together in
      a low voice</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the pleasure it would be to them if mamma would go and
      dine at Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's, where the little girl in white and that great
      tall boy lived.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Instead of staying there, or anywhere else, on Sundays,
      Mrs. Browne thought</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it her duty to go and cry over her husband's grave. The
      custom had arisen</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">out of true sorrow for his loss, for a kinder husband, and
      more worthy man,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had never lived; but the simplicity of her sorrow had been
      destroyed by the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">observation of others on the mode of its manifestation.
      They made way for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her to cross the grass toward his grave; and she, fancying
      that it was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">expected of her, fell into the habit I have mentioned. Her
      children,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">holding each a hand, felt awed and uncomfortable, and were
      sensitively</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">conscious how often they were pointed out, as a mourning
      group, to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">observation.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wish it would always rain on Sundays," said Edward one
      day to Maggie, in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a garden conference.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why?" asked she.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Because then we bustle out of church, and get home as fast
      as we can, to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">save mamma's crape; and we have not to go and cry over
      papa."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't cry," said Maggie. "Do you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward looked round before he answered, to see if they were
      quite alone,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and then said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No; I was sorry a long time about papa, but one can't go
      on being sorry</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">forever. Perhaps grown-up people can."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mamma can," said little Maggie. "Sometimes I am very sorry
      too; when I am</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by myself or playing with you, or when I am wakened up by
      the moonlight</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in our room. Do you ever waken and fancy you heard papa
      calling you? I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">do sometimes; and then I am very sorry to think we shall
      never hear him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">calling us again."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Ah, it's different with me, you know. He used to call me
      to lessons."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Sometimes he called me when he was displeased with me. But
      I always dream</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that he was calling us in his own kind voice, as he used to
      do when he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wanted us to walk with him, or to show us something
      pretty."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward was silent, playing with something on the ground. At
      last he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looked round again, and, having convinced himself that they
      could not be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">overheard, he whispered:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie--sometimes I don't think I'm sorry that papa is
      dead--when I'm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">naughty, you know; he would have been so angry with me if
      he had been here;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and I think--only sometimes, you know, I'm rather glad he
      is not."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, Edward! you don't mean to say so, I know. Don't let us
      talk about him.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">We can't talk rightly, we're such little children. Don't,
      Edward, please."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Poor little Maggie's eyes filled with tears; and she never
      spoke again to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward, or indeed to any one, about her dead father. As she
      grew older, her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">life became more actively busy. The cottage and small
      outbuildings, and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">garden and field, were their own; and on the produce they
      depended for much</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of their support. The cow, the pig, and the poultry took up
      much of Nancy's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">time. Mrs. Browne and Maggie had to do a great deal of the
      house-work; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when the beds were made, and the rooms swept and dusted,
      and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">preparations for dinner ready, then, if there was any time,
      Maggie sat down</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to her lessons. Ned, who prided himself considerably on his
      sex, had been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sitting all the morning, in his father's arm-chair, in the
      little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">book-room, "studying," as he chose to call it. Sometimes
      Maggie would pop</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her head in, with a request that he would help her to carry
      the great</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pitcher of water up-stairs, or do some other little
      household service;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with which request he occasionally complied, but with so
      many complaints</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about the interruption, that at last she told him she would
      never ask</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him again. Gently as this was said, he yet felt it as a
      reproach, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tried to excuse himself.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You see, Maggie, a man must be educated to be a gentleman.
      Now, if a woman</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">knows how to keep a house, that's all that is wanted from
      her. So my time</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is of more consequence than yours. Mamma says I'm to go to
      college, and be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a clergyman; so I must get on with my Latin."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie submitted in silence; and almost felt it as an act
      of gracious</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">condescension when, a morning or two afterwards, he came to
      meet her as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she was toiling in from the well, carrying the great brown
      jug full of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spring-water ready for dinner. "Here," said he, "let us put
      it in the shade</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">behind the horse-mount. Oh, Maggie! look what you've done!
      Spilt it all,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with not turning quickly enough when I told you. Now you
      may fetch it again</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for yourself, for I'll have nothing to do with it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I did not understand you in time," said she, softly. But
      he had turned</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">away, and gone back in offended dignity to the house.
      Maggie had nothing to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">do but return to the well, and fill it again. The spring
      was some distance</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">off, in a little rocky dell. It was so cool after her hot
      walk, that she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sat down in the shadow of the gray limestone rock, and
      looked at the ferns,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wet with the dripping water. She felt sad, she knew not
      why. "I think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Ned is sometimes very cross," thought she. "I did not
      understand he was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">carrying it there. Perhaps I am clumsy. Mamma says I am;
      and Ned says I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">am. Nancy never says so and papa never said so. I wish I
      could help being</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">clumsy and stupid. Ned says all women are so. I wish I was
      not a woman. It</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">must be a fine thing to be a man. Oh dear! I must go up the
      field again</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with this heavy pitcher, and my arms do so ache!" She rose
      and climbed the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">steep brae. As she went she heard her mother's voice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie! Maggie! there's no water for dinner, and the
      potatoes are quite</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">boiled. Where <i>is</i> that child?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">They had begun dinner, before she came down from brushing
      her hair and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">washing her hands. She was hurried and tired.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mother," said Ned, "mayn't I have some butter to these
      potatoes, as there</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is cold meat? They are so dry."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Certainly, my dear. Maggie, go and fetch a pat of butter
      out of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dairy."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie went from her untouched dinner without speaking.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Here, stop, you child!" said Nancy, turning her back in
      the passage. "You</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">go to your dinner, I'll fetch the butter. You've been
      running about enough</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to-day."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie durst not go back without it, but she stood in the
      passage till</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy returned; and then she put up her mouth to be kissed
      by the kind</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rough old servant.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Thou'rt a sweet one," said Nancy to herself, as she turned
      into the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">kitchen; and Maggie went back to her dinner with a soothed
      and lightened</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heart.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When the meal was ended, she helped her mother to wash up
      the old-fashioned</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glasses and spoons, which were treated with tender care and
      exquisite</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cleanliness in that house of decent frugality; and then,
      exchanging her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pinafore for a black silk apron, the little maiden was wont
      to sit down to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some useful piece of needlework, in doing which her mother
      enforced the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">most dainty neatness of stitches. Thus every hour in its
      circle brought a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">duty to be fulfilled; but duties fulfilled are as pleasures
      to the memory,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and little Maggie always thought those early childish days
      most happy, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remembered them only as filled with careless
      contentment.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Yet, at the time they had their cares.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">In fine summer days Maggie sat out of doors at her work.
      Just beyond the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">court lay the rocky moorland, almost as gay as that with
      its profusion of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">flowers. If the court had its clustering noisettes, and
      fraxinellas, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sweetbriar, and great tall white lilies, the moorland had
      its little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">creeping scented rose, its straggling honeysuckle, and an
      abundance of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">yellow cistus; and here and there a gray rock cropped out
      of the ground,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and over it the yellow stone-crop and scarlet-leaved
      crane's-bill grew</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">luxuriantly. Such a rock was Maggie's seat. I believe she
      considered it her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">own, and loved it accordingly; although its real owner was
      a great lord,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">who lived far away, and had never seen the moor, much less
      the piece of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gray rock, in his life.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The afternoon of the day which I have begun to tell you
      about, she was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sitting there, and singing to herself as she worked: she
      was within call of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">home, and could hear all home sounds, with their shrillness
      softened down.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Between her and it, Edward was amusing himself; he often
      called upon her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for sympathy, which she as readily gave.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wonder how men make their boats steady; I have taken
      mine to the pond,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and she has toppled over every time I sent her in."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Has it?--that's very tiresome! Would if do to put a little
      weight in it,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to keep it down?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How often must I tell you to call a ship 'her;' and there
      you will go on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">saying--it--it!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">After this correction of his sister, Master Edward did not
      like the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">condescension of acknowledging her suggestion to be a good
      one; so he went</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">silently to the house in search of the requisite ballast;
      but not being</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">able to find anything suitable, he came back to his turfy
      hillock, littered</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">round with chips of wood, and tried to insert some pebbles
      into his vessel;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but they stuck fast, and he was obliged to ask again.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Supposing it was a good thing to weight her, what could I
      put in?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie thought a moment.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Would shot do?" asked she.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It would be the very thing; but where can I get any?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There is some that was left of papa's. It is in the
      right-hand corner of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the second drawer of the bureau, wrapped up in a
      newspaper."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What a plague! I can't remember your 'seconds,' and
      'right-hands,' and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fiddle-faddles." He worked on at his pebbles. They would
      hot do.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I think if you were good-natured, Maggie, you might go for
      me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, Ned! I've all this long seam to do. Mamma said I must
      finish it before</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tea; and that I might play a little if I had done if
      first," said Maggie,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rather plaintively; for it was a real pain to her to refuse
      a request.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It would not take you five minutes."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie thought a little. The time would only be taken out
      of her playing,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which, after all, did not signify; while Edward was really
      busy about his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ship. She rose, and clambered up the steep grassy slope,
      slippery with the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heat.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Before she had found the paper of shot, she heard her
      mother's voice</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">calling, in a sort of hushed hurried loudness, as if
      anxious to be heard by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one person yet not by another--"Edward, Edward, come home
      quickly. Here's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton coming along the Fell-Lane;--he's coming here,
      as sure as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sixpence; come, Edward, come."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie saw Edward put down his ship and come. At his
      mother's bidding it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">certainly was; but he strove to make this as little
      apparent as he could,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by sauntering up the slope, with his hands in his pockets,
      in a very</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">independent and <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i>
      style. Maggie had no time to watch longer; for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">now she was called too, and down stairs she ran.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Here, Maggie," said her mother, in a nervous hurry;--"help
      Nancy to get a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tray ready all in a minute. I do believe here's Mr. Buxton
      coming to call.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Oh, Edward! go and brush your hair, and put on your Sunday
      jacket; here's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton just coming round. I'll only run up and change
      my cap; and you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">say you'll come up and tell me, Nancy; all proper, you
      know."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"To be sure, ma'am. I've lived in families afore now," said
      Nancy, gruffly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, yes, I know you have. Be sure you bring in the cowslip
      wine. I wish I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">could have stayed to decant some port."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy and Maggie bustled about, in and out of the kitchen
      and dairy; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were so deep in their preparations for Mr. Buxton's
      reception that they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were not aware of the very presence of that gentleman
      himself on the scene.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He had found the front door open, as is the wont in country
      places, and had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">walked in; first stopping at the empty parlor, and then
      finding his way to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the place where voices and sounds proclaimed that there
      were inhabitants.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">So he stood there, stooping a little under the low-browed
      lintels of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">kitchen door, and looking large, and red, and warm, but
      with a pleased and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">almost amused expression of face.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Lord bless me, sir! what a start you gave me!" said Nancy,
      as she suddenly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">caught sight of him. "I'll go and tell my missus in a
      minute that you're</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">come."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Off she went, leaving Maggie alone with the great, tall,
      broad gentleman,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">smiling at her from his frame in the door-way, but never
      speaking. She went</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on dusting a wine-glass most assiduously.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well done, little girl," came out a fine strong voice at
      last. "Now I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think that will do. Come and show me the parlor where I may
      sit down, for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I've had a long walk, and am very tired."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie took him into the parlor, which was always cool and
      fresh in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hottest weather. It was scented by a great beau-pot filled
      with roses; and,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">besides, the casement was open to the fragrant court. Mr.
      Buxton was so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">large, and the parlor so small, that when he was once in,
      Maggie thought</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when he went away, he could carry the room on his back, as
      a snail does its</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">house.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And so, you are a notable little woman, are you?" said he,
      after he had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stretched himself (a very unnecessary proceeding), and
      unbuttoned his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">waistcoat, Maggie stood near the door, uncertain whether to
      go or to stay.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How bright and clean you were making that glass! Do you
      think you could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">get me some water to fill it? Mind, it must be that very
      glass I saw you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">polishing. I shall know it again."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was thankful to escape out of the room; and in the
      passage she met</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her mother, who had made time to change her gown as well as
      her cap. Before</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy would allow the little girl to return with the glass
      of water she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">smoothed her short-cut glossy hair; it was all that was
      needed to make her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">look delicately neat. Maggie was conscientious in trying to
      find out</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the identical glass; but I am afraid Nancy was not quite so
      truthful in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">avouching that one of the six, exactly similar, which were
      now placed on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the tray, was the same she had found on the dresser, when
      she came back</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from telling her mistress of Mr. Buxton's arrival.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie carried in the water, with a shy pride in the
      clearness of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glass. Her mother was sitting on the edge of her chair,
      speaking in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">unusually fine language, and with a higher pitched voice
      than common.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward, in all his Sunday glory, was standing by Mr.
      Buxton, looking happy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and conscious. But when Maggie came in, Mr. Buxton made
      room for her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">between Edward and himself, and, while she went on talking,
      lifted her on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to his knee. She sat there as on a pinnacle of honor; but
      as she durst not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nestle up to him, a chair would have been the more
      comfortable seat.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"As founder's line, I have a right of presentation; and for
      my dear old</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">friend's sake" (here Mrs. Browne wiped her eyes), "I am
      truly glad of it;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">my young friend will have a little form of examination to
      go through; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">then we shall see him carrying every prize before him, I
      have no doubt.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Thank you, just a little of your sparkling cowslip wine.
      Ah! this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gingerbread is like the gingerbread I had when I was a boy.
      My little lady</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">here must learn the receipt, and make me some. Will
      she?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Speak to Mr. Buxton, child, who is kind to your brother.
      You will make him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some gingerbread, I am sure."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If I may," said Maggie, hanging down her head.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Or, I'll tell you what. Suppose you come to my house, and
      teach us how to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">make it there; and then, you know, we could always be
      making gingerbread</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when we were not eating it. That would be best, I think.
      Must I ask mamma</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to bring you down to Combehurst, and let us all get
      acquainted together? I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have a great boy and a little girl at home, who will like
      to see you, I'm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sure. And we have got a pony for you to ride on, and a
      peacock and guinea</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fowls, and I don't know what all. Come, madam, let me
      persuade you. School</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">begins in three weeks. Let us fix a day before then."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Do mamma," said Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am not in spirits for visiting," Mrs. Browne answered.
      But the quick</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">children detected a hesitation in her manner of saying the
      oft spoken</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">words, and had hopes, if only Mr. Buxton would persevere in
      his invitation.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Your not visiting is the very reason why you are not in
      spirits. A little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">change, and a few neighborly faces, would do you good, I'll
      be bound.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Besides, for the children's sake you should not live too
      secluded a life.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Young people should see a little of the world."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne was much obliged to Mr. Buxton for giving her
      so decent an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">excuse for following her inclination, which, it must be
      owned, tended</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to the acceptance of the invitation. So, "for the
      children's sake," she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">consented. But she sighed, as if making a sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"That's right," said Mr. Buxton. "Now for the day."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was fixed that they should go on that day week; and
      after some further</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">conversation about the school at which Edward was to be
      placed, and some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">more jokes about Maggie's notability, and an inquiry if she
      would come and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">live with him the next time he wanted a housemaid, Mr.
      Buxton took his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">leave.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">His visit had been an event; and they made no great attempt
      at settling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">again that day to any of their usual employments. In the
      first place, Nancy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came in to hear and discuss all the proposed plans. Ned,
      who was uncertain</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">whether to like or dislike the prospect of school, was very
      much offended</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by the old servant's remark, on first hearing of the
      project.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It's time for him. He'll learn his place there, which, it
      strikes me, he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and others too are apt to forget at home."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Then followed discussions and arrangements respecting his
      clothes. And then</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">they came to the plan of spending a day at Mr. Buxton's,
      which Mrs. Browne</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was rather shy of mentioning, having a sort of an idea of
      inconstancy and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">guilt connected with the thought of mingling with the world
      again. However,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy approved: "It was quite right," and "just as it
      should be," and "good</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for the children."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes; it was on their account I did it, Nancy," said Mrs.
      Browne.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How many children has Mr. Buxton?" asked Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Only one. Frank, I think, they call him. But you must say
      Master Buxton;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be sure."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Who is the little girl, then," asked Maggie, "who sits
      with them in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">church?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh! that's little Miss Harvey, his niece, and a great
      fortune."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"They do say he never forgave her mother till the day of
      her death,"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remarked Nancy.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Then they tell stories, Nancy!" replied Mrs. Browne (it
      was she herself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">who had said it; but that was before Mr. Buxton's call).
      For d'ye think his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sister would have left him guardian to her child, if they
      were not on good</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">terms?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well! I only know what folks say. And, for sure, he took a
      spite at Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Harvey for no reason on earth; and every one knows he never
      spoke to him."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He speaks very kindly and pleasantly," put in Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Ay; and I'm not saying but what he is a very good, kind
      man in the main.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But he has his whims, and keeps hold on 'em when he's got
      'em. There's them</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pies burning, and I'm talking here!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When Nancy had returned to her kitchen, Mrs. Browne called
      Maggie up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stairs, to examine what clothes would be needed for Edward.
      And when they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were up, she tried on the black satin gown, which had been
      her visiting</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dress ever since she was married, and which she intended
      should replace</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the old, worn-out bombazine on the day of the visit to
      Combehurst.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"For Mrs. Buxton is a real born lady," said she; "and I
      should like to be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">well dressed, to do her honor."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I did not know there was a Mrs. Buxton," said Maggie. "She
      is never at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">church."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No; she is but delicate and weakly, and never leaves the
      house. I think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her maid told me she never left her room now."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The Buxton family, root and branch, formed the
      <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">conversation between Mrs. Browne and her children for the
      next week. As the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">day drew near, Maggie almost wished to stay at home, so
      impressed was she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with the awfulness of the visit. Edward felt bold in the
      idea of a new</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suit of clothes, which had been ordered for the occasion,
      and for school</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">afterwards. Mrs. Browne remembered having heard the rector
      say, "A woman</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never looked so lady-like as when she wore black satin,"
      and kept her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spirits up with that observation; but when she saw how worn
      it was at the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">elbows, she felt rather depressed, and unequal to visiting.
      Still, for her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">children's sake, she would do much.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">After her long day's work was ended, Nancy sat up at her
      sewing. She had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">found out that among all the preparations, none were going
      on for Margaret;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and she had used her influence over her mistress (who
      half-liked and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">half-feared, and entirely depended upon her) to obtain from
      her an old</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gown, which she had taken to pieces, and washed and
      scoured, and was now</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">making up, in a way a little old-fashioned to be sure; but,
      on the whole,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it looked so nice when completed and put on, that Mrs.
      Browne gave Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a strict lecture about taking great care of such a handsome
      frock and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">forgot that she had considered the gown from which if had
      been made as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">worn out and done for.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER II.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">At length they were dressed, and Nancy stood on the
      court-steps, shading</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her eyes, and looking after them, as they climbed the
      heathery slope</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">leading to Combehurst.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wish she'd take her hand sometimes, just to let her know
      the feel of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her mother's hand. Perhaps she will, at least after Master
      Edward goes to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">school."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">As they went along, Mrs. Browne gave the children a few
      rules respecting</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">manners and etiquette.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie! you must sit as upright as ever you can; make your
      back flat,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">child, and don't poke. If I cough, you must draw up. I
      shall cough whenever</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I see you do anything wrong, and I shall be looking at you
      all day; so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remember. You hold yourself very well, Edward. If Mr.
      Buxton asks you, you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">may have a glass of wine, because you're a boy. But mind
      and say, 'Your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">good health, sir,' before you drink it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'd rather not have the wine if I'm to say that," said
      Edward, bluntly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, nonsense! my dear. You'd wish to be like a gentleman,
      I'm sure."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward muttered something which was inaudible. His mother
      went on:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Of course you'll never think of being helped more than
      twice. Twice of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">meat, twice of pudding, is the genteel thing. You may take
      less, but never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">more."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, mamma! how beautiful Combehurst spire is, with that
      dark cloud behind</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it!" exclaimed Maggie, as they came in sight of the
      town.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You've no business with Combehurst spire when I'm speaking
      to you. I'm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">talking myself out of breath to teach you how to behave,
      and there you go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looking after clouds, and such like rubbish. I'm ashamed of
      you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Although Maggie walked quietly by her mother's side all the
      rest of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">way, Mrs. Browne was too much offended to resume her
      instructions on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">good-breeding. Maggie might be helped three times if she
      liked: she had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">done with her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">They were very early. When they drew near the bridge, they
      were met by a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tall, fine-looking boy, leading a beautiful little Shetland
      pony, with a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">side-saddle on it. He came up to Mrs. Browne, and addressed
      her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My father thought your little girl would be tired, and he
      told me to bring</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">my cousin Erminia's pony for her. It's as quiet as can
      be."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Now this was rather provoking to Mrs. Browne, as she chose
      to consider</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie in disgrace. However, there was no help for it: all
      she could do was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to spoil the enjoyment as far as possible, by looking and
      speaking in a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cold manner, which often chilled Maggie's little heart, and
      took all the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">zest out of the pleasure now. It was in vain that Frank
      Buxton made the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pony trot and canter; she still looked sad and grave.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Little dull thing!" he thought; but he was as kind and
      considerate as a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gentlemanly boy could be.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">At last they reached Mr. Buxton's house. It was in the main
      street, and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">front door opened upon it by a flight of steps. Wide on
      each side extended</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the stone-coped windows. It was in reality a mansion, and
      needed not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the neighboring contrast of the cottages on either side to
      make it look</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">imposing. When they went in, they entered a large hall,
      cool even on that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">burning July day, with a black and white flag floor, and
      old settees</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">round the walls, and great jars of curious china, which
      were filled with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pot-pourrie. The dusky gloom was pleasant, after the glare
      of the street</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">outside; and the requisite light and cheerfulness were
      given by the peep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">into the garden, framed, as it were, by the large door-way
      that opened into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it. There were roses, and sweet-peas, and poppies--a rich
      mass of color,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which looked well, set in the somewhat sombre coolness of
      the hall. All the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">house told of wealth--wealth which had accumulated for
      generations, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which was shown in a sort of comfortable, grand,
      unostentatious way. Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's ancestors had been yeomen; but, two or three
      generations back,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">they might, if ambitious, have taken their place as country
      gentry, so much</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had the value of their property increased, and so great had
      been the amount</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of their savings. They, however, continued to live in the
      old farm till Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's grandfather built the house in Combehurst of which
      I am speaking,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and then he felt rather ashamed of what he had done; it
      seemed like</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stepping out of his position. He and his wife always sat in
      the best</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">kitchen; and it was only after his son's marriage that the
      entertaining</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rooms were furnished. Even then they were kept with closed
      shutters</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and bagged-up furniture during the lifetime of the old
      couple, who,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nevertheless, took a pride in adding to the rich-fashioned
      ornaments and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">grand old china of the apartments. But they died, and were
      gathered to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">their fathers, and young Mr. and Mrs. Buxton (aged
      respectively fifty-one</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and forty-five) reigned in their stead. They had the good
      taste to make no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sudden change; but gradually the rooms assumed an inhabited
      appearance, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">their son and daughter grew up in the enjoyment of great
      wealth, and no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">small degree of refinement. But as yet they held back
      modestly from putting</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">themselves in any way on a level with the county people.
      Lawrence Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was sent to the same school as his father had been before
      him; and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">notion of his going to college to complete his education
      was, after some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">deliberation, negatived. In process of time he succeeded
      his father, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">married a sweet, gentle lady, of a decayed and very poor
      county family, by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">whom he had one boy before she fell into delicate health.
      His sister had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">married a man whose character was worse than his fortune,
      and had been left</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a widow. Everybody thought her husband's death a blessing;
      but she loved</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him, in spite of negligence and many grosser faults; and
      so, not many years</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">after, she died, leaving her little daughter to her
      brother's care, with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">many a broken-voiced entreaty that he would never speak a
      word against</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the dead father of her child. So the little Erminia was
      taken home by her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">self-reproaching uncle, who felt now how hardly he had
      acted towards his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sister in breaking off all communication with her on her
      ill-starred</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">marriage.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Where is Erminia, Frank?" asked his father, speaking over
      Maggie's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shoulder, while he still held her hand. "I want to take
      Mrs. Browne to your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother. I told Erminia to be here to welcome this little
      girl."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'll take her to Minnie; I think she's in the garden. I'll
      come back to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you," nodding to Edward, "directly, and then we will go to
      the rabbits."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">So Frank and Maggie left the great lofty room, full of
      strange rare</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">things, and rich with books, and went into the sunny
      scented garden, which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stretched far and wide behind the house. Down one of the
      walks, with a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hedge of roses on either side, came a little tripping
      fairy, with long</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">golden ringlets, and a complexion like a china rose. With
      the deep blue of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the summer sky behind her, Maggie thought she looked like
      an angel. She</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">neither hastened nor slackened her pace when she saw them,
      but came on with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the same dainty light prancing step.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Make haste, Minnie," cried Frank.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But Minnie stopped to gather a rose.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Don't stay with me," said Maggie, softly, although she had
      held his hand</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">like that of a friend, and did not feel that the little
      fairy's manner was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">particularly cordial or gracious. Frank took her at her
      word, and ran off</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia came a little quicker when she saw that Maggie was
      left alone; but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for some time after they were together, they had nothing to
      say to each</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">other. Erminia was easily impressed by the pomps and
      vanities of the world;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and Maggie's new handsome frock seemed to her made of old
      ironed brown</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">silk. And though Maggie's voice was soft, with a silver
      ringing sound in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it, she pronounced her words in Nancy's broad country way.
      Her hair was cut</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">short all round; her shoes were thick, and clumped as she
      walked. Erminia</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">patronized her, and thought herself very kind and
      condescending; but they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were not particularly friendly. The visit promised to be
      more honorable</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">than agreeable, and Maggie almost wished herself at home
      again. Dinner-time</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came. Mrs. Buxton dined in her own room. Mr. Buxton was
      hearty, and jovial,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and pressing; he almost scolded Maggie because she would
      not take more than</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">twice of his favorite pudding: but she remembered what her
      mother had said,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and that she would be watched all day; and this gave her a
      little prim,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quaint manner, very different from her usual soft charming
      unconsciousness.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She fancied that Edward and Master Buxton were just as
      little at their ease</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with each other as she and Miss Harvey. Perhaps this
      feeling on the part of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the boys made all four children unite after dinner.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Let us go to the swing in the shrubbery," said Frank,
      after a little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">consideration; and off they ran. Frank proposed that he and
      Edward should</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">swing the two little girls; and for a time all went on very
      well. But</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by-and-by Edward thought, that Maggie had had enough, and
      that he should</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">like a turn; and Maggie, at his first word, got out.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Don't you like swinging?" asked Erminia.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes! but Edward would like it now." And Edward accordingly
      took her place.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank turned away, and would not swing him. Maggie strove
      hard to do it,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but he was heavy, and the swing bent unevenly. He scolded
      her for what</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she could not help, and at last jumped out so roughly, that
      the seat hit</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie's face, and knocked her down. When she got up, her
      lips quivered</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with pain, but she did not cry; she only looked anxiously
      at her frock.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">There was a great rent across the front breadth. Then she
      did shed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tears--tears of fright. What would her mother say?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia saw her crying.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Are you hurt?" said she, kindly. "Oh, how your check is
      swelled! What a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rude, cross boy your brother is!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I did not know he was going to jump out. I am not crying
      because I am</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hurt, but because of this great rent in my nice new frock.
      Mamma will be so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">displeased."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Is it a new frock?" asked Erminia.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It is a new one for me. Nancy has sat up several nights to
      make it. Oh!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what shall I do?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia's little heart was softened by such excessive
      poverty. A best frock</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">made of shabby old silk! She put her arms round Maggie's
      neck, and said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Come with me; we will go to my aunt's dressing-room, and
      Dawson will give</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me some silk, and I'll help you to mend it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"That's a kind little Minnie," said Frank. Ned had turned
      sulkily away. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">do not think the boys were ever cordial again that day;
      for, as Frank said</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to his mother, "Ned might have said he was sorry; but he is
      a regular</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tyrant to that little brown mouse of a sister of his."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia and Maggie went, with their arms round each other's
      necks, to Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's dressing-room. The misfortune had made them
      friends. Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton lay on the sofa; so fair and white and colorless, in
      her muslin</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dressing-gown, that when Maggie first saw the lady lying
      with her eyes</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shut, her heart gave a start, for she thought she was dead.
      But she opened</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her large languid eyes, and called them to her, and
      listened to their story</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with interest.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dawson is at tea. Look, Minnie, in my work-box; there is
      some silk there.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Take off your frock, my dear, and bring it here, and let me
      see how it can</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be mended."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Aunt Buxton," whispered Erminia, "do let me give her one
      of my frocks.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">This is such an old thing."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No, love. I'll tell you why afterwards," answered Mrs.
      Buxton.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She looked at the rent, and arranged if nicely for the
      little girls to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mend. Erminia helped Maggie with right good will. As they
      sat on the floor,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Buxton thought what a pretty contrast they made;
      Erminia, dazzlingly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fair, with her golden ringlets, and her pale-blue frock;
      Maggie's little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">round white shoulders peeping out of her petticoat; her
      brown hair as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glossy and smooth as the nuts that it resembled in color;
      her long black</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">eye-lashes drooping over her clear smooth cheek, which
      would have given the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">idea of delicacy, but for the coral lips that spoke of
      perfect health: and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when she glanced up, she showed long, liquid, dark-gray
      eyes. The deep red</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the curtain behind, threw out these two little figures
      well.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Dawson came up. She was a grave elderly person, of whom
      Erminia was far</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">more afraid than she was of her aunt; but at Mrs. Buxton's
      desire she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">finished mending the frock for Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Buxton has asked some of your mamma's old friends to
      tea, as I am not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">able to go down. But I think, Dawson, I must have these two
      little girls to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tea with me. Can you be very quiet, my dears; or shall you
      think it dull?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">They gladly accepted the invitation; and Erminia promised
      all sorts of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fanciful promises as to quietness; and went about on her
      tiptoes in such</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a labored manner, that Mrs. Buxton begged her at last not
      to try and be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quiet, as she made much less noise when she did not. It was
      the happiest</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">part of the day to Maggie. Something in herself was so much
      in harmony with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Buxton's sweet, resigned gentleness, that it answered
      like an echo,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and the two understood each other strangely well. They
      seemed like old</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">friends, Maggie, who was reserved at home because no one
      cared to hear what</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she had to say, opened out, and told Erminia and Mrs.
      Buxton all about her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">way of spending her day, and described her home.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How odd!" said Erminia. "I have ridden that way on
      Abdel-Kadr, and never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seen your house."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It is like the place the Sleeping Beauty lived in; people
      sometimes seem</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to go round it and round it, and never find it. But unless
      you follow a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little sheep-track, which seems to end at a gray piece of
      rock, you may</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">come within a stone's throw of the chimneys and never see
      them. I think you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would think it so pretty. Do you ever come that way,
      ma'am?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No, love," answered Mrs. Buxton.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But will you some time?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am afraid I shall never be able to go out again," said
      Mrs. Buxton, in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a voice which, though low, was very cheerful. Maggie
      thought how sad a lot</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was here before her; and by-and-by she took a little stool,
      and sat by Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's sofa, and stole her hand into hers.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne was in full tide of pride and happiness down
      stairs. Mr. Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had a number of jokes; which would have become dull from
      repetition (for he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">worked a merry idea threadbare before he would let if go),
      had if not been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for his jovial blandness and good-nature. He liked to make
      people happy,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and, as far as bodily wants went, he had a quick perception
      of what was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">required. He sat like a king (for, excepting the rector,
      there was not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">another gentleman of his standing at Combehurst), among six
      or seven</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ladies, who laughed merrily at all his sayings, and
      evidently thought Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Browne had been highly honored in having been asked to
      dinner as well as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to tea. In the evening, the carriage was ordered to take
      her as far as a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">carriage could go; and there was a little mysterious
      handshaking between</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her host and herself on taking leave, which made her very
      curious for the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lights of home by which to examine a bit of rustling paper
      that had been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">put in her hand with some stammered-out words about
      Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When every one had gone, there was a little gathering in
      Mrs. Buxton's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dressing-room. Husband, son and niece, all came to give her
      their opinions</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on the day and the visitors.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Good Mrs. Browne is a little tiresome," said Mr. Buxton,
      yawning. "Living</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in that moorland hole, I suppose. However, I think she has
      enjoyed her day;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and we'll ask her down now and then, for Browne's sake.
      Poor Browne! What a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">good man he was!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't like that boy at all," said Frank. "I beg you'll
      not ask him again</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">while I'm at home: he is so selfish and self-important; and
      yet he's a bit</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">snobbish now and then. Mother! I know what you mean by that
      look. Well! if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I am self-important sometimes, I'm not a snob."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Little Maggie is very nice," said Erminia. "What a pity
      she has not a new</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">frock! Was not she good about it, Frank, when she tore
      it?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes, she's a nice little thing enough, if she does not get
      all spirit</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cowed out of her by that brother. I'm thankful that he is
      going to school."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When Mrs. Browne heard where Maggie had drank tea, she was
      offended. She</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had only sat with Mrs. Buxton for an hour before dinner. If
      Mrs. Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">could bear the noise of children, she could not think why
      she shut herself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up in that room, and gave herself such airs. She supposed
      it was because</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she was the granddaughter of Sir Henry Biddulph that she
      took upon herself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to have such whims, and not sit at the head of her table,
      or make tea for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her company in a civil decent way. Poor Mr. Buxton! What a
      sad life for a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">merry, light-hearted man to have such a wife! It was a good
      thing for him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to have agreeable society sometimes. She thought he looked
      a deal better</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for seeing his friends. He must be sadly moped with that
      sickly wife.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">(If she had been clairvoyante at that moment, she might
      have seen Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton tenderly chafing his wife's hands, and feeling in
      his innermost soul</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a wonder how one so saint-like could ever have learnt to
      love such a boor</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as he was; it was the wonderful mysterious blessing of his
      life. So little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">do we know of the inner truths of the households, where we
      come and go like</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intimate guests!)</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie could not bear to hear Mrs. Buxton spoken of as a
      fine lady assuming</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">illness. Her heart beat hard as she spoke. "Mamma! I am
      sure she is really</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ill. Her lips kept going so white; and her hand was so
      burning hot all the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">time that I held it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Have you been holding Mrs. Buxton's hand? Where were your
      manners? You are</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a little forward creature, and ever were. But don't pretend
      to know better</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">than your elders. It is no use telling me Mrs. Buxton is
      ill, and she able</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to bear the noise of children."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I think they are all a pack of set-up people, and that
      Frank Buxton is the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">worst of all," said Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie's heart sank within her to hear this cold, unkind
      way of talking</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">over the friends who had done so much to make their day
      happy. She had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never before ventured into the world, and did not know how
      common and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">universal is the custom of picking to pieces those with
      whom we have just</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been associating; and so it pained her. She was a little
      depressed, too,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with the idea that she should never see Mrs. Buxton and the
      lovely Erminia</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">again. Because no future visit or intercourse had been
      spoken about, she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fancied it would never take place; and she felt like the
      man in the Arabian</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nights, who caught a glimpse of the precious stones and
      dazzling glories</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the cavern, which was immediately after closed, and shut
      up into the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">semblance of hard, barren rock. She tried to recall the
      house. Deep blue,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">crimson red, warm brown draperies, were so striking after
      the light</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">chintzes of her own house; and the effect of a suite of
      rooms opening out</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of each other was something quite new to the little girl;
      the apartments</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seemed to melt away into vague distance, like the dim
      endings of the arched</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">aisles in church. But most of all she tried to recall Mrs.
      Buxton's face;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and Nancy had at last to put away her work, and come to
      bed, in order to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">soothe the poor child, who was crying at the thought that
      Mrs. Buxton would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">soon die, and that she should never see her again. Nancy
      loved Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dearly, and felt no jealousy of this warm admiration of the
      unknown lady.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She listened to her story and her fears till the sobs were
      hushed; and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">moon fell through the casement on the white closed eyelids
      of one, who</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">still sighed in her sleep.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER III.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">In three weeks, the day came for Edward's departure. A
      great cake and a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">parcel of gingerbread soothed his sorrows on leaving
      home.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Don't cry, Maggie!" said he to her on the last morning;
      "you see I don't.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Christmas will soon be here, and I dare say I shall find
      time to write to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you now and then. Did Nancy put any citron in the
      cake?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie wished she might accompany her mother to Combehurst
      to see Edward</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">off by the coach; but it was not to be. She went with them,
      without her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bonnet, as far as her mother would allow her; and then she
      sat down, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">watched their progress for a long, long way. She was
      startled by the sound</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of a horse's feet, softly trampling through the long
      heather. It was Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My father thought Mrs. Browne would like to see the
      Woodchester Herald. Is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward gone?" said he, noticing her sad face.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes! he is just gone down the hill to the coach. I dare
      say you can see</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him crossing the bridge, soon. I did so want to have gone
      with him,"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">answered she, looking wistfully toward the town.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank felt sorry for her, left alone to gaze after her
      brother, whom,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">strange as it was, she evidently regretted. After a
      minute's silence, he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You liked riding the other day. Would you like a ride now?
      Rhoda is very</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gentle, if you can sit on my saddle. Look! I'll shorten the
      stirrup. There</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">now; there's a brave little girl! I'll lead her very
      carefully. Why,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia durst not ride without a side-saddle! I'll tell you
      what; I'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bring the newspaper every Wednesday till I go to school,
      and you shall have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a ride. Only I wish we had a side-saddle for Rhoda. Or, if
      Erminia will let</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me, I'll bring Abdel-Kadr, the little Shetland you rode the
      other day."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But will Mr. Buxton let you?" asked Maggie, half
      delighted--half afraid.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, my father! to be sure he will. I have him in very good
      order."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was rather puzzled by this way of speaking.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"When do you go to school?" asked she.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Toward the end of August; I don't know the day."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Does Erminia go to school?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No. I believe she will soon though, if mamma does not get
      better." Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">liked the change of voice, as he spoke of his mother.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There, little lady! now jump down. Famous! you've a deal
      of spirit, you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little brown mouse."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy came out, with a wondering look, to receive
      Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It is Mr. Frank Buxton," said she, by way of an
      introduction. "He has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">brought mamma the newspaper."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Will you walk in, sir, and rest? I can tie up your
      horse."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No, thank you," said he, "I must be off. Don't forget,
      little mousey, that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you are to ready for another ride next Wednesday." And away
      he went.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It needed a good deal of Nancy's diplomacy to procure
      Maggie this pleasure;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">although I don't know why Mrs. Browne should have denied
      it, for the circle</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">they went was always within sight of the knoll in front of
      the house, if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">any one cared enough about the matter to mount it, and look
      after them.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank and Maggie got great friends in these rides. Her
      fearlessness</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">delighted and surprised him, she had seemed so cowed and
      timid at first.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But she was only so with people, as he found out before
      holidays ended.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He saw her shrink from particular looks and inflexions of
      voice of her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother's; and learnt to read them, and dislike Mrs. Browne
      accordingly,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">notwithstanding all her sugary manner toward himself. The
      result of his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">observations he communicated to his mother, and in
      consequence, he was the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bearer of a most civil and ceremonious message from Mrs.
      Buxton to Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Browne, to the effect that the former would be much obliged
      to the latter</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if she would allow Maggie to ride down occasionally with
      the groom, who</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would bring the newspapers on the Wednesdays (now Frank was
      going to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">school), and to spend the afternoon with Erminia. Mrs.
      Browne consented,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">proud of the honor, and yet a little annoyed that no
      mention was made of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself. When Frank had bid good-bye, and fairly
      disappeared, she turned to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You must not set yourself up if you go among these fine
      folks. It is their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">way of showing attention to your father and myself. And you
      must mind and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">work doubly hard on Thursdays to make up for playing on
      Wednesdays."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was in a flush of sudden color, and a happy
      palpitation of her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fluttering little heart. She could hardly feel any sorrow
      that the kind</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank was going away, so brimful was she of the thoughts of
      seeing his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother; who had grown strangely associated in her dreams,
      both sleeping</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and waking, with the still calm marble effigies that lay
      for ever clasping</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">their hands in prayer on the altar-tombs in Combehurst
      church. All the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">week was one happy season of anticipation. She was afraid
      her mother was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">secretly irritated at her natural rejoicing; and so she did
      not speak to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her about it, but she kept awake till Nancy came to bed,
      and poured into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her sympathizing ears every detail, real or imaginary, of
      her past or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">future intercourse with Mrs. Buxton, and the old servant
      listened with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">interest, and fell into the custom of picturing the future
      with the ease</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and simplicity of a child.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Suppose, Nancy! only suppose, you know, that she did die.
      I don't mean</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">really die, but go into a trance like death; she looked as
      if she was in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one when I first saw her; I would not leave her, but I
      would sit by her,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and watch her, and watch her."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Her lips would be always fresh and red," interrupted
      Nancy.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes, I know you've told me before how they keep red--I
      should look at them</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quite steadily; I would try never to go to sleep."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"The great thing would be to have air-holes left in the
      coffin." But Nancy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">felt the little girl creep close to her at the grim
      suggestion, and, with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the tact of love, she changed the subject.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Or supposing we could hear of a doctor who could charm
      away illness. There</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were such in my young days; but I don't think people are so
      knowledgeable</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">now. Peggy Jackson, that lived near us when I was a girl,
      was cured of a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">waste by a charm."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What is a waste, Nancy?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It is just a pining away. Food does not nourish nor drink
      strengthen them,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but they just fade off, and grow thinner and thinner, till
      their shadow</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looks gray instead of black at noonday; but he cured her in
      no time by a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">charm."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, if we could find him."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Lass, he's dead, and she's dead, too, long ago!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">While Maggie was in imagination going over moor and fell,
      into the hollows</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the distant mysterious hills, where she imagined all
      strange beasts and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">weird people to haunt, she fell asleep.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Such were the fanciful thoughts which were engendered in
      the little girl's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mind by her secluded and solitary life. It was more
      solitary than ever, now</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that Edward was gone to school. The house missed his loud
      cheerful voice,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and bursting presence. There seemed much less to be done,
      now that his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">numerous wants no longer called for ministration and
      attendance. Maggie did</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her task of work on her own gray rock; but as it was sooner
      finished, now</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that he was not there to interrupt and call her off, she
      used to stray up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the Fell Lane at the back of the house; a little steep
      stony lane, more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">like stairs cut in the rock than what we, in the level
      land, call a lane:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it reached on to the wide and open moor, and near its
      termination there</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was a knotted thorn-tree; the only tree for apparent miles.
      Here the sheep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">crouched under the storms, or stood and shaded themselves
      in the noontide</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heat. The ground was brown with their cleft round
      foot-marks; and tufts of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wool were hung on the lower part of the stem, like votive
      offerings on some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shrine. Here Maggie used to come and sit and dream in any
      scarce half-hour</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of leisure. Here she came to cry, when her little heart was
      overfull at her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother's sharp fault-finding, or when bidden to keep out of
      the way, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not be troublesome. She used to look over the swelling
      expanse of moor, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the tears were dried up by the soft low-blowing wind which
      came sighing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">along it. She forgot her little home griefs to wonder why a
      brown-purple</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shadow always streaked one particular part in the fullest
      sunlight; why the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cloud-shadows always seemed to be wafted with a sidelong
      motion; or she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would imagine what lay beyond those old gray holy hills,
      which seemed to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bear up the white clouds of Heaven on which the angels flew
      abroad. Or she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would look straight up through the quivering air, as long
      as she could bear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">its white dazzling, to try and see God's throne in that
      unfathomable and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">infinite depth of blue. She thought she should see it blaze
      forth sudden</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and glorious, if she were but full of faith. She always
      came down from the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thorn, comforted, and meekly gentle.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But there was danger of the child becoming dreamy, and
      finding her pleasure</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in life in reverie, not in action, or endurance, or the
      holy rest which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">comes after both, and prepares for further striving or
      bearing. Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's kindness prevented this danger just in time. It
      was partly out of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">interest in Maggie, but also partly to give Erminia a
      companion, that she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wished the former to come down to Combehurst.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When she was on these visits, she received no regular
      instruction; and yet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all the knowledge, and most of the strength of her
      character, was derived</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from these occasional hours. It is true her mother had
      given her daily</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lessons in reading, writing, and arithmetic; but both
      teacher and taught</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">felt these more as painful duties to be gone through, than
      understood them</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as means to an end. The "There! child; now that's done
      with," of relief,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from Mrs. Browne, was heartily echoed in Maggie's breast,
      as the dull</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">routine was concluded.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Buxton did not make a set labor of teaching; I suppose
      she felt that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">much was learned from her superintendence, but she never
      thought of doing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or saying anything with a latent idea of its indirect
      effect upon the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little girls, her companions. She was simply herself; she
      even confessed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">(where the confession was called for) to short-comings, to
      faults, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never denied the force of temptations, either of those
      which beset little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">children, or of those which occasionally assailed herself.
      Pure, simple,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and truthful to the heart's core, her life, in its
      uneventful hours and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">days, spoke many homilies. Maggie, who was grave,
      imaginative, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">somewhat quaint, took pains in finding words to express the
      thoughts to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which her solitary life had given rise, secure of Mrs.
      Buxton's ready</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">understanding and sympathy.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You are so like a cloud," said she to Mrs. Buxton. "Up at
      the Thorn-tree,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it was quite curious how the clouds used to shape
      themselves, just</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">according as I was glad or sorry. I have seen the same
      clouds, that, when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I came up first, looked like a heap of little snow-hillocks
      over babies'</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">graves, turn, as soon as I grew happier, to a sort of long
      bright row of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">angels. And you seem always to have had some sorrow when I
      am sad, and turn</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bright and hopeful as soon as I grow glad. Dear Mrs.
      Buxton! I wish Nancy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">knew you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The gay, volatile, willful, warm-hearted Erminia was less
      earnest in all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">things. Her childhood had been passed amid the distractions
      of wealth; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">passionately bent upon the attainment of some object at one
      moment, the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">next found her angry at being reminded of the vanished
      anxiety she had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shown but a moment before. Her life was a shattered mirror;
      every part</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dazzling and brilliant, but wanting the coherency and
      perfection of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a whole. Mrs. Buxton strove to bring her to a sense of the
      beauty of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">completeness, and the relation which qualities and objects
      bear to each</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">other; but in all her striving she retained hold of the
      golden clue of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sympathy. She would enter into Erminia's eagerness, if the
      object of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it varied twenty times a day; but by-and-by, in her own
      mild, sweet,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suggestive way, she would place all these objects in their
      right and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fitting places, as they were worthy of desire. I do not
      know how it was,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but all discords, and disordered fragments, seemed to fall
      into harmony and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">order before her presence.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She had no wish to make the two little girls into the same
      kind of pattern</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">character. They were diverse as the lily and the rose. But
      she tried to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">give stability and earnestness to Erminia; while she aimed
      to direct</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie's imagination, so as to make it a great minister to
      high ends,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">instead of simply contributing to the vividness and
      duration of a reverie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She told her tales of saints and martyrs, and all holy
      heroines, who forgot</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">themselves, and strove only to be "ministers of Him, to do
      His pleasure."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The tears glistened in the eyes of hearer and speaker,
      while she spoke in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her low, faint voice, which was almost choked at times when
      she came to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">noblest part of all.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But when she found that Maggie was in danger of becoming
      too little a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dweller in the present, from the habit of anticipating the
      occasion for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some great heroic action, she spoke of other heroines. She
      told her how,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">though the lives of these women of old were only known to
      us through some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">striking glorious deed, they yet must have built up the
      temple of their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">perfection by many noiseless stories; how, by small daily
      offerings laid</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on the altar, they must have obtained their beautiful
      strength for the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">crowning sacrifice. And then she would turn and speak of
      those whose names</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will never be blazoned on earth--some poor maid-servant, or
      hard-worked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">artisan, or weary governess--who have gone on through life
      quietly, with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">holy purposes in their hearts, to which they gave up
      pleasure and ease,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in a soft, still, succession of resolute days. She quoted
      those lines of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">George Herbert's:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; "All may have,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; If they dare choose, a glorious life, or grave."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And Maggie's mother was disappointed because Mrs. Buxton
      had never offered</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to teach her "to play on the piano," which was to her the
      very head and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">front of a genteel education. Maggie, in all her time of
      yearning to become</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Joan of Arc, or some great heroine, was unconscious that
      she herself showed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">no little heroism, in bearing meekly what she did every day
      from her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother. It was hard to be questioned about Mrs. Buxton, and
      then to have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her answers turned into subjects for contempt, and
      fault-finding with that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sweet lady's ways.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When Ned came home for the holidays, he had much to tell.
      His mother</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">listened for hours to his tales; and proudly marked all
      that she could note</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of his progress in learning. His copy-books and
      writing-flourishes were a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sight to behold; and his account-books contained towers and
      pyramids of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">figures.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Ay, ay!" said Mr. Buxton, when they were shown to him;
      "this is grand!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when I was a boy I could make a flying eagle with one
      stroke of my pen,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but I never could do all this. And yet I thought myself a
      fine fellow, I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">warrant you. And these sums! why man! I must make you my
      agent. I need one,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I'm sure; for though I get an accountant every two or three
      years to do</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up my books, they somehow have the knack of getting wrong
      again. Those</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quarries, Mrs. Browne, which every one says are so
      valuable, and for the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stone out of which receive orders amounting to hundreds of
      pounds, what</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">d'ye think was the profit I made last year, according to my
      books?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'm sure I don't know, sir; something very great, I've no
      doubt."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Just seven-pence three farthings," said he, bursting into
      a fit of merry</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">laughter, such as another man would have kept for the
      announcement of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">enormous profits. "But I must manage things differently
      soon. Frank will</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">want money when he goes to Oxford, and he shall have it.
      I'm but a rough</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sort of fellow, but Frank shall take his place as a
      gentleman. Aha, Miss</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie! and where's my gingerbread? There you go, creeping
      up to Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton on a Wednesday, and have never taught Cook how to
      make gingerbread</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">yet. Well, Ned! and how are the classics going on? Fine
      fellow, that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Virgil! Let me see, how does it begin?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; 'Arma, virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab
      oris.'</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">That's pretty well, I think, considering I've never opened
      him since I left</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">school thirty years ago. To be sure, I spent six hours a
      day at it when I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was there. Come now, I'll puzzle you. Can you construe
      this?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; "Infir dealis, inoak noneis; inmud eelis, inclay
      noneis."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"To be sure I can," said Edward, with a little contempt in
      his tone. "Can</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you do this, sir?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; "Apud in is almi des ire,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mimis tres i neve require,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Alo veri findit a gestis,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; His miseri ne ver at restis."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But though Edward had made much progress, and gained three
      prizes, his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">moral training had been little attended to. He was more
      tyrannical than</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ever, both to his mother and Maggie. It was a drawn battle
      between him and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy, and they kept aloof from each other as much as
      possible. Maggie fell</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">into her old humble way of submitting to his will, as long
      as it did not go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">against her conscience; but that, being daily enlightened
      by her habits of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pious aspiring thought, would not allow her to be so
      utterly obedient as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">formerly. In addition to his imperiousness, he had learned
      to affix the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">idea of cleverness to various artifices and subterfuges
      which utterly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">revolted her by their meanness.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You are so set up, by being intimate with Erminia, that
      you won't do a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thing I tell you; you are as selfish and self-willed
      as"--he made a pause.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was ready to cry.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I will do anything, Ned, that is right."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well! and I tell you this is right."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How can it be?" said she, sadly, almost wishing to be
      convinced.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How--why it is, and that's enough for you. You must always
      have a reason</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for everything now. You are not half so nice as you were.
      Unless one chops</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">logic with you, and convinces you by a long argument,
      you'll do nothing. Be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">obedient, I tell you. That is what a woman has to be."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I could be obedient to some people, without knowing their
      reasons, even</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">though they told me to do silly things," said Maggie, half
      to herself.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I should like to know to whom," said Edward,
      scornfully.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"To Don Quixote," answered she, seriously; for, indeed, he
      was present in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her mind just then, and his noble, tender, melancholy
      character had made a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">strong impression there.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward stared at her for a moment, and then burst into a
      loud fit of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">laughter. It had the good effect of restoring him to a
      better frame of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mind. He had such an excellent joke against his sister,
      that he could not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be angry with her. He called her Sancho Panza all the rest
      of the holidays,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">though she protested against it, saying she could not bear
      the Squire, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">disliked being called by his name.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank and Edward seemed to have a mutual antipathy to each
      other, and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coldness between them was rather increased than diminished
      by all Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's efforts to bring them together. "Come, Frank, my
      lad!" said he,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"don't be so stiff with Ned. His father was a dear friend
      of mine, and I've</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">set my heart on seeing you friends. You'll have it in your
      power to help</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him on in the world."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But Frank answered, "He is not quite honorable, sir. I
      can't bear a boy who</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is not quite honorable. Boys brought up at those private
      schools are so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">full of tricks!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Nay, my lad, there thou'rt wrong. I was brought up at a
      private school,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and no one can say I ever dirtied my hands with a trick in
      my life. Good</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">old Mr. Thompson would have flogged the life out of a boy
      who did anything</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mean or underhand."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER IV.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Summers and winters came and went, with little to mark
      them, except the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">growth of the trees, and the quiet progress of young
      creatures. Erminia was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sent to school somewhere in France, to receive more regular
      instruction</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">than she could have in the house with her invalid aunt. But
      she came home</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">once a year, more lovely and elegant and dainty than ever;
      and Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought, with truth, that ripening years were softening
      down her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">volatility, and that her aunt's dewlike sayings had quietly
      sunk deep, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fertilized the soil. That aunt was fading away. Maggie's
      devotion added</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">materially to her happiness; and both she and Maggie never
      forgot that this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">devotion was to be in all things subservient to the duty
      which she owed to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her mother.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My love," Mrs. Buxton had more than once said, "you must
      always recollect</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that your first duty is toward your mother. You know how
      glad I am to see</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you; but I shall always understand how it is, if you do not
      come. She may</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">often want you when neither you nor I can anticipate
      it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne had no great wish to keep Maggie at home,
      though she liked to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">grumble at her going. Still she felt that it was best, in
      every way, to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">keep on good terms with such valuable friends; and she
      appreciated, in some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">small degree, the advantage which her intimacy at the house
      was to Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But yet she could not restrain a few complaints, nor
      withhold from her, on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her return, a recapitulation of all the things which might
      have been done</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if she had only been at home, and the number of times that
      she had been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wanted; but when she found that Maggie quietly gave up her
      next Wednesday's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">visit as soon as she was made aware of any necessity for
      her presence at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">home, her mother left off grumbling, and took little or no
      notice of her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">absence.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When the time came for Edward to leave school, he announced
      that he had no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intention of taking orders, but meant to become an
      attorney.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It's such slow work," said he to his mother. "One toils
      away for four or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">five years, and then one gets a curacy of seventy pounds
      a-year, and no end</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of work to do for the money. Now the work is not much
      harder in a lawyer's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">office, and if one has one's wits about one, there are
      hundreds and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thousands a-year to be picked up with mighty little
      trouble."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne was very sorry for this determination. She had
      a great desire</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to see her son a clergyman, like his father. She did not
      consider whether</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his character was fitted for so sacred an office; she
      rather thought that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the profession itself, when once assumed, would purify the
      character; but,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in fact, his fitness or unfitness for holy orders entered
      little into her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mind. She had a respect for the profession, and his father
      had belonged to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I had rather see you a curate at seventy pounds a-year,
      than an attorney</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with seven hundred," replied she. "And you know your father
      was always</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">asked to dine everywhere--to places where I know they would
      not have asked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Bish, of Woodchester, and he makes his thousand a-year.
      Besides, Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton has the next presentation to Combehurst, and you
      would stand a good</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">chance for your father's sake. And in the mean time you
      should live here,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if your curacy was any way near."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I dare say! Catch me burying myself here again. My dear
      mother, it's a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very respectable place for you and Maggie to live in, and I
      dare say</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you don't find it dull; but the idea of my quietly sitting
      down here is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something too absurd!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Papa did, and was very happy," said Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes! after he had been at Oxford," replied Edward, a
      little nonplussed by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this reference to one whose memory even the most selfish
      and thoughtless</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">must have held in respect.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well! and you know you would have to go to Oxford
      first."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie! I wish you would not interfere between my mother
      and me. I want</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to have it settled and done with, and that it will never be
      if you keep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">meddling. Now, mother, don't you see how much better it
      will be for me to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">go into Mr. Bish's office? Harry Bish has spoken to his
      father about it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne sighed.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What will Mr. Buxton say?" asked she, dolefully.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Say! Why don't you see it was he who first put it into my
      head, by telling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me that first Christmas holidays, that I should be his
      agent. That would be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something, would it not? Harry Bish says he thinks a
      thousand a-year might</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ha made of it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">His loud, decided, rapid talking overpowered Mrs. Browne;
      but she resigned</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself to his wishes with more regrets than she had ever
      done before. It</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was not the first case in which fluent declamation has
      taken the place of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">argument.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward was articled to Mr. Bish, and thus gained his point.
      There was no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one with power to resist his wishes, except his mother and
      Mr. Buxton. The</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">former had long acknowledged her son's will as her law; and
      the latter,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">though surprised and almost disappointed at a change of
      purpose which he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had never anticipated in his plans for Edward's benefit,
      gave his consent,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and even advanced some of the money requisite for the
      premium.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie looked upon this change with mingled feelings. She
      had always from a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">child pictured Edward to herself as taking her father's
      place. When she had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought of him as a man, it was as contemplative, grave,
      and gentle, as she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remembered her father. With all a child's deficiency of
      reasoning power,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she had never considered how impossible it was that a
      selfish, vain,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and impatient boy could become a meek, humble, and pious
      man, merely by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">adopting a profession in which such qualities are required.
      But now, at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sixteen, she was beginning to understand all this. Not by
      any process of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought, but by something more like a correct feeling, she
      perceived that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward would never be the true minister of Christ. So, more
      glad and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thankful than sorry, though sorrow mingled with her
      sentiments, she learned</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the decision that he was to be an attorney.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank Buxton all this time was growing up into a young man.
      The hopes both</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of father and mother were bound up in him; and, according
      to the difference</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in their characters was the difference in their hopes. It
      seemed, indeed,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">probable that Mr. Buxton, who was singularly void of
      worldliness or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ambition for himself, would become worldly and ambitious
      for his son. His</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hopes for Frank were all for honor and distinction here.
      Mrs. Buxton's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hopes were prayers. She was fading away, as light fades
      into darkness on a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">summer evening. No one seemed to remark the gradual
      progress; but she was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fully conscious of it herself. The last time that Frank was
      at home from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">college before her death, she knew that she should never
      see him again;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and when he gaily left the house, with a cheerfulness,
      which was partly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">assumed, she dragged herself with languid steps into a room
      at the front</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the house, from which she could watch him down the long,
      straggling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little street, that led to the inn from which the coach
      started. As he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">went along, he turned to look back at his home; and there
      he saw his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother's white figure gazing after him. He could not see
      her wistful eyes,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but he made her poor heart give a leap of joy by turning
      round and running</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">back for one more kiss and one more blessing.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When he next came home, it was at the sudden summons of her
      death.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">His father was as one distracted. He could not speak of the
      lost angel</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">without sudden bursts of tears, and oftentimes of
      self-upbraiding, which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">disturbed the calm, still, holy ideas, which Frank liked to
      associate with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her. He ceased speaking to him, therefore, about their
      mutual loss; and it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was a certain kind of relief to both when he did so; but he
      longed for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some one to whom he might talk of his mother, with the
      quiet reverence of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intense and trustful affection. He thought of Maggie, of
      whom he had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seen but little of late; for when he had been at
      Combehurst, she had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">felt that Mrs. Buxton required her presence less, and had
      remained more at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">home. Possibly Mrs. Buxton regretted this; but she never
      said anything.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She, far-looking, as one who was near death, foresaw that,
      probably, if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie and her son met often in her sick-room, feelings
      might arise which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would militate against her husband's hopes and plans, and
      which, therefore,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she ought not to allow to spring up. But she had been
      unable to refrain</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from expressing her gratitude to Maggie for many hours of
      tranquil</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">happiness, and had unconsciously dropped many sentences
      which made Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">feel, that, in the little brown mouse of former years, he
      was likely to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">meet with one who could tell him much of the inner history
      of his mother in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her last days, and to whom he could speak of her without
      calling out the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">passionate sorrow which was so little in unison with her
      memory.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Accordingly, one afternoon, late in the autumn, he rode up
      to Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Browne's. The air on the heights was so still that nothing
      seemed to stir.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Now and then a yellow leaf came floating down from the
      trees, detached from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">no outward violence, but only because its life had reached
      its full limit</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and then ceased. Looking down on the distant sheltered
      woods, they were</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gorgeous in orange and crimson, but their splendor was felt
      to be the sign</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the decaying and dying year. Even without an inward
      sorrow, there was a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">grand solemnity in the season which impressed the mind, and
      hushed it into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tranquil thought. Frank rode slowly along, and quietly
      dismounted at the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">old horse-mount, beside which there was an iron bridle-ring
      fixed in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the gray stone wall. He saw the casement of the
      parlor-window open, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie's head bent down over her work. She looked up as he
      entered the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">court, and his footsteps sounded on the flag-walk. She came
      round and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">opened the door. As she stood in the door-way, speaking, he
      was struck by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her resemblance to some old painting. He had seen her
      young, calm face,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shining out with great peacefulness, and the large, grave,
      thoughtful eyes,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">giving the character to the features which otherwise they
      might, from their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very regularity, have wanted. Her brown dress had the exact
      tint which a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">painter would have admired. The slanting mellow sunlight
      fell upon her as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she stood; and the vine-leaves, already frost-tinted, made
      a rich, warm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">border, as they hung over the old house-door.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mamma is not well; she is gone to lie down. How are you?
      How is Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"We are both pretty well; quite well, in fact, as far as
      regards health.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">May I come in? I want to talk to you, Maggie!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She opened the little parlor-door, and they went in; but
      for a time they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were both silent. They could not speak of her who was with
      them, present</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in their thoughts. Maggie shut the casement, and put a log
      of wood on the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fire. She sat down with her back to the window; but as the
      flame sprang up,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and blazed at the touch of the dry wood, Frank saw that her
      face was wet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with quiet tears. Still her voice was even and gentle, as
      she answered his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">questions. She seemed to understand what were the very
      things he would care</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">most to hear. She spoke of his mother's last days; and
      without any word of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">praise (which, indeed, would have been impertinence), she
      showed such a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">just and true appreciation of her who was dead and gone,
      that he felt as if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he could listen forever to the sweet-dropping words. They
      were balm to his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sore heart. He had thought it possible that the suddenness
      of her death</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">might have made her life incomplete, in that she might have
      departed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">without being able to express wishes and projects, which
      would now have the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sacred force of commands. But he found that Maggie, though
      she had never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intruded herself as such, had been the depository of many
      little thoughts</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and plans; or, if they were not expressed to her, she knew
      that Mr. Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or Dawson was aware of what they were, though, in their
      violence of early</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">grief, they had forgotten to name them. The flickering
      brightness of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">flame had died away; the gloom of evening had gathered into
      the room,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">through the open door of which the kitchen fire sent a
      ruddy glow,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">distinctly marked against carpet and wall. Frank still sat,
      with his head</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">buried in his hands against the table, listening.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Tell me more," he said, at every pause.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I think I have told you all now," said Maggie, at last.
      "At least, it is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all I recollect at present; but if I think of anything
      more, I will be sure</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and tell you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Thank you; do." He was silent for some time.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Erminia is coming home at Christmas. She is not to go back
      to Paris again.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She will live with us. I hope you and she will be great
      friends, Maggie."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh yes," replied she. "I think we are already. At least we
      were last</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Christmas. You know it is a year since I have seen
      her."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes; she went to Switzerland with Mademoiselle Michel,
      instead of coming</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">home the last time. Maggie, I must go, now. My father will
      be waiting</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dinner for me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dinner! I was going to ask if you would not stay to tea. I
      hear mamma</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stirring about in her room. And Nancy is getting things
      ready, I see. Let</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me go and tell mamma. She will not be pleased unless she
      sees you. She has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been very sorry for you all," added she, dropping her
      voice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Before he could answer, she ran up stairs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne came down.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, Mr. Frank! Have you been sitting in the dark? Maggie,
      you ought to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have rung for candles! Ah! Mr. Frank, you've had a sad loss
      since I saw you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">here--let me see--in the last week of September. But she
      was always a sad</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">invalid; and no doubt your loss is her gain. Poor Mr.
      Buxton, too! How is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he? When one thinks of him, and of her years of illness, it
      seems like a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">happy release."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She could have gone on for any length of time, but Frank
      could not bear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this ruffling up of his soothed grief, and told her that
      his father was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">expecting him home to dinner.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Ah! I am sure you must not disappoint him. He'll want a
      little cheerful</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">company more than ever now. You must not let him dwell on
      it, Mr. Frank,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but turn his thoughts another way by always talking of
      other things. I am</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sure if I had some one to speak to me in a cheerful,
      pleasant way, when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">poor dear Mr. Browne died, I should never have fretted
      after him as I did;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but the children were too young, and there was no one to
      come and divert</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me with any news. If I'd been living in Combehurst, I am
      sure I should not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have let my grief get the better of me as I did. Could you
      get up a quiet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rubber in the evenings, do you think?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But Frank had shaken hands and was gone. As he rode home he
      thought much of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sorrow, and the different ways of bearing it. He decided
      that it was sent</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by God for some holy purpose, and to call out into
      existence some higher</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">good; and he thought that if it were faithfully taken as
      His decree there</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would be no passionate, despairing resistance to it; nor
      yet, if it were</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">trustfully acknowledged to have some wise end, should we
      dare to baulk it,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and defraud it by putting it on one side, and, by seeking
      the distractions</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of worldly things, not let it do its full work. And then he
      returned to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his conversation with Maggie. That had been real comfort to
      him. What an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">advantage it would be to Erminia to have such a girl for a
      friend and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">companion!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was rather strange that, having this thought, and having
      been struck, as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I said, with Maggie's appearance while she stood in the
      door-way (and I may</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">add that this impression of her unobtrusive beauty had been
      deepened by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">several succeeding interviews), he should reply as he did
      to Erminia's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remark, on first seeing Maggie after her return from
      France.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How lovely Maggie is growing! Why, I had no idea she would
      ever turn out</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pretty. Sweet-looking she always was; but now her style of
      beauty makes her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">positively distinguished. Frank! speak! is not she
      beautiful?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Do you think so?" answered he, with a kind of lazy
      indifference,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">exceedingly gratifying to his father, who was listening
      with some eagerness</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to his answer. That day, after dinner, Mr. Buxton began to
      ask his opinion</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of Erminia's appearance.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank answered at once:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"She is a dazzling little creature. Her complexion looks as
      if it were made</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of cherries and milk; and, it must be owned, the little
      lady has studied</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the art of dress to some purpose in Paris."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton was nearer happiness at this reply than he had
      ever been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">since his wife's death; for the only way he could devise to
      satisfy his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">reproachful conscience towards his neglected and unhappy
      sister, was to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">plan a marriage between his son and her child. He rubbed
      his hands and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">drank two extra glasses of wine.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"We'll have the Brownes to dinner, as usual, next
      Thursday," said he, "I am</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sure your mother would have been hurt if we had omitted it;
      it is now nine</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">years since they began to come, and they have never missed
      one Christmas</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">since. Do you see any objection, Frank?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"None at all, sir," answered he. "I intend to go up to town
      soon after</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Christmas, for a week or ten days, on my way to Cambridge.
      Can I do</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">anything for you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well, I don't know. I think I shall go up myself some day
      soon. I can't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">understand all these lawyer's letters, about the purchase
      of the Newbridge</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">estate; and I fancy I could make more sense out of it all,
      if I saw Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Hodgson."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wish you would adopt my plan, of having an agent, sir.
      Your affairs are</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">really so complicated now, that they would take up the time
      of an expert</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">man of business. I am sure all those tenants at Dumford
      ought to be seen</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">after."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I do see after them. There's never a one that dares cheat
      me, or that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would cheat me if they could. Most of them have lived under
      the Buxtons for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">generations. They know that if they dared to take advantage
      of me, I should</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">come down upon them pretty smartly."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Do you rely upon their attachment to your family--or on
      their idea of your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">severity?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"On both. They stand me instead of much trouble in
      account-keeping, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">those eternal lawyers' letters some people are always
      dispatching to their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tenants. When I'm cheated, Frank, I give you leave to make
      me have an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">agent, but not till then. There's my little Erminia singing
      away, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nobody to hear her."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER V.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Christmas-Day was strange and sad. Mrs. Buxton had always
      contrived to be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in the drawing-room, ready to receive them all after
      dinner. Mr. Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tried to do away with his thoughts of her by much talking;
      but every now</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and then he looked wistfully toward the door. Erminia
      exerted herself to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be as lively as she could, in order, if possible, to fill
      up the vacuum.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward, who had come over from Woodchester for a walk, had
      a good deal to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">say; and was, unconsciously, a great assistance with his
      never-ending flow</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of rather clever small-talk. His mother felt proud of her
      son, and his new</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">waistcoat, which was far more conspicuously of the latest
      fashion than</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank's could be said to be. After dinner, when Mr. Buxton
      and the two</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">young men were left alone, Edward launched out still more.
      He thought he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was impressing Frank with his knowledge of the world, and
      the world's ways.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But he was doing all in his power to repel one who had
      never been much</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">attracted toward him. Worldly success was his standard of
      merit. The end</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seemed with him to justify the means; if a man prospered,
      if was not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">necessary to scrutinize his conduct too closely. The law
      was viewed in its</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lowest aspect; and yet with a certain cleverness, which
      preserved Edward</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from being intellectually contemptible. Frank had
      entertained some idea of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">studying for a barrister himself: not so much as a means of
      livelihood as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to gain some idea of the code which makes and shows a
      nation's conscience:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but Edward's details of the ways in which the letter so
      often baffles the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spirit, made him recoil. With some anger against himself,
      for viewing the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">profession with disgust, because it was degraded by those
      who embraced it,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">instead of looking upon it as what might be ennobled and
      purified into a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">vast intelligence by high and pure-minded men, he got up
      abruptly and left</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the room.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The girls were sitting over the drawing-room fire, with
      unlighted candles</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on the table, talking, he felt, about his mother; but when
      he came in they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rose, and changed their tone. Erminia went to the piano,
      and sang her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">newest and choicest French airs. Frank was gloomy and
      silent; but when she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">changed into more solemn music his mood was softened,
      Maggie's simple and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hearty admiration, untinged by the slightest shade of envy
      for Erminia's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accomplishments, charmed him. The one appeared to him the
      perfection of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">elegant art, the other of graceful nature. When he looked
      at Maggie,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and thought of the moorland home from which she had never
      wandered, the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mysteriously beautiful lines of Wordsworth seemed to become
      sun-clear to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; "And she shall lean her ear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; In many a secret place</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Where rivulets dance their wayward round,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; And beauty born of murmuring sound</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Shall pass into her face."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton, in the dining-room, was really getting to take
      an interest in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward's puzzling cases. They were like tricks at cards. A
      quick motion,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and out of the unpromising heap, all confused together,
      presto! the right</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">card turned up. Edward stated his case, so that there did
      not seem loophole</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for the desired verdict; but through some conjuration, it
      always came</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">uppermost at last. He had a graphic way of relating things;
      and, as he did</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not spare epithets in his designation of the opposing
      party, Mr. Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">took it upon trust that the defendant or the prosecutor (as
      it might</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">happen) was a "pettifogging knave," or a "miserly
      curmudgeon," and rejoiced</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accordingly in the triumph over him gained by the ready wit
      of "our</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">governor," Mr. Bish. At last he became so deeply impressed
      with Edward's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge of law, as to consult him about some cottage
      property he had in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Woodchester.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I rather think there are twenty-one cottages, and they
      don't bring me in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">four pounds a-year; and out of that I have to pay for
      collecting. Would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">there be any chance of selling them? They are in
      Doughty-street; a bad</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">neighborhood, I fear."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Very bad," was Edward's prompt reply. "But if you are
      really anxious to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">effect a sale, I have no doubt I could find a purchaser in
      a short time."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I should be very much obliged to you," said Mr. Buxton.
      "You would be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">doing me a kindness. If you meet with a purchaser, and can
      manage the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">affair, I would rather that you drew out the deeds for the
      transfer of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">property. If would be the beginning of business for you;
      and I only hope I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">should bring you good luck."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Of course Edward could do this; and when they left the
      table, it was with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a feeling on his side that he was a step nearer to the
      agency which he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coveted; and with a happy consciousness on Mr. Buxton's of
      having put a few</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pounds in the way of a deserving and remarkably clever
      young man.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Since Edward had left home, Maggie had gradually, but
      surely, been gaining</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in importance. Her judgment and her untiring unselfishness
      could not fail</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to make way. Her mother had some respect for, and great
      dependence on her;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but still it was hardly affection that she felt for her; or
      if it was it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was a dull and torpid kind of feeling, compared with the
      fond love and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">exulting pride which she took in Edward. When he came back
      for occasional</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">holidays, his mother's face was radiant with happiness, and
      her manner</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">toward him was even more caressing than he approved of.
      When Maggie saw him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">repel the hand that fain would have stroked his hair as in
      childish days,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a longing came into her heart for some of these uncared-for
      tokens of her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother's love. Otherwise she meekly sank back into her old
      secondary place,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">content to have her judgment slighted and her wishes
      unasked as long as he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stayed. At times she was now beginning to disapprove and
      regret some things</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in him; his flashiness of manner jarred against her taste;
      and a deeper,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">graver feeling was called out by his evident want of quick
      moral</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">perception. "Smart and clever," or "slow and dull," took
      with him the place</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of "right and wrong." Little as he thought it, he was
      himself narrow-minded</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and dull; slow and blind to perceive the beauty and eternal
      wisdom of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">simple goodness.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia and Maggie became great friends. Erminia used to
      beg for Maggie,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">until she herself put a stop to the practice; as she saw
      her mother yielded</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">more frequently than was convenient, for the honor of
      having her daughter</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a visitor at Mr. Buxton's, about which she could talk to
      her few</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">acquaintances who persevered in calling at the cottage.
      Then Erminia</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">volunteered a visit of some days to Maggie, and Mrs.
      Browne's pride was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">redoubled; but she made so many preparations, and so much
      fuss, and gave</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself so much trouble, that she was positively ill during
      Erminia's stay;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and Maggie felt that she must henceforward deny herself the
      pleasure of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">having her friend for a guest, as her mother could not be
      persuaded from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">attempting to provide things in the same abundance and
      style as that to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which Erminia was accustomed at home; whereas, as Nancy
      shrewdly observed,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the young lady did not know if she was eating jelly, or
      porridge, or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">whether the plates were common delf or the best China, so
      long as she was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with her dear Miss Maggie. Spring went, and summer came.
      Frank had gone to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and fro between Cambridge and Combehurst, drawn by motives
      of which he felt</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the force, but into which he did not care to examine.
      Edward had sold the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">property of Mr. Buxton; and he, pleased with the possession
      of half the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">purchase money (the remainder of which was to be paid by
      installments), and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">happy in the idea that his son came over so frequently to
      see Erminia, had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">amply rewarded the young attorney for his services.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">One summer's day, as hot as day could be, Maggie had been
      busy all morning;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for the weather was so sultry that she would not allow
      either Nancy or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her mother to exert themselves much. She had gone down with
      the old brown</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pitcher, coeval with herself, to the spring for water; and
      while it was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">trickling, and making a tinkling music, she sat down on the
      ground. The</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">air was so still that she heard the distant wood-pigeons
      cooing; and round</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about her the bees were murmuring busily among the
      clustering heath. From</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some little touch of sympathy with these low sounds of
      pleasant harmony,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she began to try and hum some of Erminia's airs. She never
      sang out loud,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or put words to her songs; but her voice was very sweet,
      and it was a great</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pleasure to herself to let it go into music. Just as her
      jug was filled,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she was startled by Frank's sudden appearance. She thought
      he was at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Cambridge, and, from some cause or other, her face, usually
      so faint in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">color, became the most vivid scarlet. They were both too
      conscious to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">speak. Maggie stooped (murmuring some words of surprise) to
      take up her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pitcher.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Don't go yet, Maggie," said he, putting his hand on hers
      to stop her; but,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">somehow, when that purpose was effected, he forgot to take
      it off again. "I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have come all the way from Cambridge to see you. I could
      not bear suspense</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">any longer. I grew so impatient for certainty of some kind,
      that I went up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to town last night, in order to feel myself on my way to
      you, even though</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I knew I could not be here a bit earlier to-day for doing
      so. Maggie--dear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie! how you are trembling! Have I frightened you? Nancy
      told me you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were here; but it was very thoughtless to come so suddenly
      upon you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was not the suddenness of his coming; it was the
      suddenness of her own</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heart, which leaped up with the feelings called out by his
      words. She</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">went very white, and sat down on the ground as before. But
      she rose again</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">immediately, and stood, with drooping, averted head. He had
      dropped her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hand, but now sought to take it again.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, darling, may I speak?" Her lips moved, he saw, but
      he could not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hear. A pang of affright ran through him that, perhaps, she
      did not wish to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">listen. "May I speak to you?" he asked again, quite
      timidly. She tried to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">make her voice sound, but it would not; so she looked
      round. Her soft</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gray eyes were eloquent in that one glance. And, happier
      than his words,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">passionate and tender as they were, could tell, he spoke
      till her trembling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was changed into bright flashing blushes, and even a shy
      smile hovered</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about her lips, and dimpled her cheeks.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The water bubbled over the pitcher unheeded. At last she
      remembered all the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">work-a-day world. She lifted up the jug, and would have
      hurried home, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank decidedly took it from her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Henceforward," said he, "I have a right to carry your
      burdens." So with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one arm round her waist and with the other carrying the
      water, they climbed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the steep turfy slope. Near the top she wanted to take it
      again.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mamma will not like it. Mamma will think if so
      strange."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why, dearest, if I saw Nancy carrying it up this slope I
      would take it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from her. It would be strange if a man did not carry it for
      any woman.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But you must let me tell your mother of my right to help
      you. If is your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dinner-time is it not? I may come in to dinner as one of
      the family may not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I Maggie?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No" she said softly. For she longed to be alone; and she
      dreaded being</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">overwhelmed by the expression of her mother's feelings,
      weak and agitated</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as she felt herself. "Not to-day."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Not to-day!" said he reproachfully. "You are very hard
      upon me. Let me</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">come to tea. If you will, I will leave you now. Let me come
      to early tea. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">must speak to my father. He does not know I am here. I may
      come to tea. At</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what time is it? Three o'clock. Oh, I know you drink tea at
      some strange</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">early hour; perhaps it is at two. I will take care to be in
      time."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Don't come till five, please. I must tell mamma; and I
      want some time to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think. It does seem so like a dream. Do go, please."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well! if I must, I must. But I don't feel as if I were in
      a dream, but in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some real blessed heaven so long as I see you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">At last he went. Nancy was awaiting Maggie, the
      side-gate.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Bless us and save us, bairn! what a time it has taken thee
      to get the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">water. Is the spring dry with the hot weather?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie ran past her. All dinner-time she heard her mother's
      voice in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">long-continued lamentation about something. She answered at
      random, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">startled her mother by asserting that she thought "it" was
      very good;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the said "it" being milk turned sour by thunder. Mrs.
      Browne spoke quite</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sharply, "No one is so particular as you, Maggie. I have
      known you drink</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">water, day after day, for breakfast, when you were a little
      girl, because</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">your cup of milk had a drowned fly in it; and now you tell
      me you don't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">care for this, and don't mind that, just as if you could
      eat up all the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">things which are spoiled by the heat. I declare my head
      aches so, I shall</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">go and lie down as soon as ever dinner is over."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">If this was her plan, Maggie thought she had no time to
      lose in making her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">confession. Frank would be here before her mother got up
      again to tea. But</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she dreaded speaking about her happiness; it seemed as yet
      so cobweb-like,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as if a touch would spoil its beauty.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mamma, just wait a minute. Just sit down in your chair
      while I tell you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something. Please, dear mamma." She took a stool, and sat
      at her mother's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">feet; and then she began to turn the wedding-ring on Mrs.
      Browne's hand,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looking down and never speaking, till the latter became
      impatient.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What is if you have got to say, child? Do make haste, for
      I want to go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up-stairs."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">With a great jerk of resolution, Maggie said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mamma, Frank Buxton has asked me to marry him."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She hid her face in her mother's lap for an instant; and
      then she lifted it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up, as brimful of the light of happiness as is the cup of a
      water-lily of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the sun's radiance.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie--you don't say so," said her mother, half
      incredulously. "It can't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be, for he's at Cambridge, and it's not post-day. What do
      you mean?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He came this morning, mother, when I was down at the well;
      and we fixed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that I was to speak to you; and he asked if he might come
      again for tea."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dear! dear! and the milk all gone sour? We should have had
      milk of our</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">own, if Edward had not persuaded me against buying another
      cow."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't think Mr. Buxton will mind it much," said Maggie,
      dimpling up, as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she remembered, half unconsciously, how little he had
      seemed to care for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">anything but herself.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why, what a thing it is for you!" said Mrs. Browne, quite
      roused up from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her languor and her head-ache. "Everybody said he was
      engaged to Miss</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia. Are you quite sure you made no mistake, child?
      What did he say?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Young men are so fond of making fine speeches; and young
      women are so silly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in fancying they mean something. I once knew a girl who
      thought that a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gentleman who sent her mother a present of a sucking-pig,
      did it as a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">delicate way of making her an offer. Tell me his exact
      words."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But Maggie blushed, and either would not or could not. So
      Mrs. Browne began</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">again:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well, if you're sure, you're sure. I wonder how he brought
      his father</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">round. So long as he and Erminia have been planned for each
      other! That</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very first day we ever dined there after your father's
      death, Mr. Buxton as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">good as told me all about it. I fancied they were only
      waiting till they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were out of mourning."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">All this was news to Maggie. She had never thought that
      either Erminia or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank was particularly fond of the other; still less had
      she had any idea</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of Mr. Buxton's plans for them. Her mother's surprise at
      her engagement</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">jarred a little upon her too: it had become so natural,
      even in these last</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">two hours, to feel that she belonged to
      <i>him</i>. But there were more discords</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to come. Mrs. Browne began again, half in soliloquy:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I should think he would have four thousand a-year. He did
      not tell you,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">love, did he, if they had still that bad property in the
      canal, that his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father complained about? But he will have four thousand.
      Why, you'll have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">your carriage, Maggie. Well! I hope Mr. Buxton has taken it
      kindly, because</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he'll have a deal to do with the settlements. I'm sure I
      thought he was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">engaged to Erminia."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Ringing changes on these subjects all the afternoon, Mrs.
      Browne sat with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie. She occasionally wandered off to speak about
      Edward, and how</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">favorably his future prospects would be advanced by the
      engagement.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Let me see--there's the house in Combehurst: the rent of
      that would be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a hundred and fifty a-year, but we'll not reckon that. But
      there's the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quarries" (she was reckoning upon her fingers in default of
      a slate, for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which she had vainly searched), "we'll call them two
      hundred a-year, for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I don't believe Mr. Buxton's stories about their only
      bringing him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in seven-pence; and there's Newbridge, that's certainly
      thirteen</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hundred--where had I got to, Maggie?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dear mamma, do go and lie down for a little; you look
      quite flushed," said</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie, softly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Was this the manner to view her betrothal with such a man
      as Frank?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Her mother's remarks depressed her more than she could have
      thought it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">possible; the excitement of the morning was having its
      reaction, and she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">longed to go up to the solitude under the thorn-tree, where
      she had hoped</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to spend a quiet, thoughtful afternoon.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy came in to replace glasses and spoons in the
      cupboard. By some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accident, the careful old servant broke one of the former.
      She looked up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quickly at her mistress, who usually visited all such
      offences with no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">small portion of rebuke.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Never mind, Nancy," said Mrs. Browne. "It's only an old
      tumbler;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and Maggie's going to be married, and we must buy a new set
      for the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wedding-dinner."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy looked at both, bewildered; at last a light dawned
      into her mind, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her face looked shrewdly and knowingly back at Mrs. Browne.
      Then she said,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very quietly:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I think I'll take the next pitcher to the well myself, and
      try my luck. To</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think how sorry I was for Miss Maggie this morning! 'Poor
      thing,' says I to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">myself, 'to be kept all this time at that confounded well'
      (for I'll not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">deny that I swear a bit to myself at times--it sweetens the
      blood), 'and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she so tired.' I e'en thought I'd go help her; but I reckon
      she'd some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">other help. May I take a guess at the young man?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Four thousand a-year! Nancy;" said Mrs. Browne,
      exultingly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And a blithe look, and a warm, kind heart--and a free
      step--and a noble</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">way with him to rich and poor--aye, aye, I know the name.
      No need to alter</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all my neat M.B.'s, done in turkey-red cotton. Well, well!
      every one's turn</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">comes sometime, but mine's rather long a-coming."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The faithful old servant came up to Maggie, and put her
      hand caressingly on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her shoulder. Maggie threw her arms round her neck, and
      kissed the brown,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">withered face.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"God bless thee, bairn," said Nancy, solemnly. It brought
      the low music of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">peace back into the still recesses of Maggie's heart. She
      began to look out</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for her lover; half-hidden behind the muslin window
      curtain, which waved</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gently to and fro in the afternoon breezes. She heard a
      firm, buoyant step,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and had only time to catch one glimpse of his face, before
      moving away. But</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that one glance made her think that the hours which had
      elapsed since she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">saw him had not been serene to him any more than to
      her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When he entered the parlor, his face was glad and bright.
      He went up in a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">frank, rejoicing way to Mrs. Browne; who was evidently
      rather puzzled</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">how to receive him--whether as Maggie's betrothed, or as
      the son of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">greatest man of her acquaintance.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am sure, sir," said she, "we are all very much obliged
      to you for the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">honor you have done our family!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He looked rather perplexed as to the nature of the honor
      which he had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">conferred without knowing it; but as the light dawned upon
      him, he made</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">answer in a frank, merry way, which was yet full of respect
      for his future</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother-in-law:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And I am sure I am truly grateful for the honor one of
      your family has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">done me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When Nancy brought in tea she was dressed in her
      fine-weather Sunday gown;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the first time it had ever been worn out of church, and the
      walk to and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fro.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">After tea, Frank asked Maggie if she would walk out with
      him; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accordingly they climbed the Fell-Lane and went out upon
      the moors, which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seemed vast and boundless as their love.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Have you told your father?" asked Maggie; a dim anxiety
      lurking in her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heart.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes," said Frank. He did not go on; and she feared to ask,
      although she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">longed to know, how Mr. Buxton had received the
      intelligence.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What did he say?" at length she inquired.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh! it was evidently a new idea to him that I was attached
      to you; and he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">does not take up a new idea speedily. He has had some
      notion, it seems,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that Erminia and I were to make a match of it; but she and
      I agreed, when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">we talked it over, that we should never have fallen in love
      with each other</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if there had not been another human being in the world.
      Erminia is a little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sensible creature, and says she does not wonder at any man
      falling in love</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with you. Nay, Maggie, don't hang your head so down; let me
      have a glimpse</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of your face."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am sorry your father does not like it," said Maggie,
      sorrowfully.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"So am I. But we must give him time to get reconciled.
      Never fear but he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will like it in the long run; he has too much good taste
      and good feeling.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He must like you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank did not choose to tell even Maggie how violently his
      father had set</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">himself against their engagement. He was surprised and
      annoyed at first to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">find how decidedly his father was possessed with the idea
      that he was to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">marry his cousin, and that she, at any rate, was attached
      to him, whatever</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his feelings might be toward her; but after he had gone
      frankly to Erminia</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and told her all, he found that she was as ignorant of her
      uncle's plans</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for her as he had been; and almost as glad at any event
      which should</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">frustrate them.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Indeed she came to the moorland cottage on the following
      day, after Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had returned to Cambridge. She had left her horse in charge
      of the groom,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">near the fir-trees on the heights, and came running down
      the slope in her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">habit. Maggie went out to meet her, with just a little
      wonder at her heart</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if what Frank had said could possibly be true; and that
      Erminia, living in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the house with him, could have remained indifferent to him.
      Erminia threw</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her arms round her neck, and they sat down together on the
      court-steps.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I durst not ride down that hill; and Jem is holding my
      horse, so I may not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stay very long; now begin, Maggie, at once, and go into a
      rhapsody about</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank. Is not he a charming fellow? Oh! I am so glad. Now
      don't sit smiling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and blushing there to yourself; but tell me a great deal
      about it. I have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so wanted to know somebody that was in love, that I might
      hear what it was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">like; and the minute I could, I came off here. Frank is
      only just gone. He</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has had another long talk with my uncle, since he came back
      from you this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">morning; but I am afraid he has not made much way yet."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie sighed. "I don't wonder at his not thinking me good
      enough for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No! the difficulty would be to find any one he did think
      fit for his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">paragon of a son."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He thought you were, dearest Erminia."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"So Frank has told you that, has he? I suppose we shall
      have no more family</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">secrets now," said Erminia, laughing. "But I can assure you
      I had a strong</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rival in lady Adela Castlemayne, the Duke of Wight's
      daughter; she was the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">most beautiful lady my uncle had ever seen (he only saw her
      in the Grand</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Stand at Woodchester races, and never spoke a word to her
      in his life). And</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if she would have had Frank, my uncle would still have been
      dissatisfied</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as long as the Princess Victoria was unmarried; none would
      have been good</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">enough while a better remained. But Maggie," said she,
      smiling up into her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">friend's face, "I think it would have made you laugh, for
      all you look as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if a kiss would shake the tears out of your eyes, if you
      could have seen my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">uncle's manner to me all day. He will have it that I am
      suffering from an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">unrequited attachment; so he watched me and watched me over
      breakfast; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at last, when I had eaten a whole nest-full of eggs, and I
      don't know how</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">many pieces of toast, he rang the bell and asked for some
      potted charr. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was quite unconscious that it was for me, and I did not
      want it when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it came; so he sighed in a most melancholy manner, and
      said, 'My poor</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia!' If Frank had not been there, and looking
      dreadfully miserable, I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">am sure I should have laughed out."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Did Frank look miserable?" said Maggie, anxiously.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There now! you don't care for anything but the mention of
      his name."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But did he look unhappy?" persisted Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I can't say he looked happy, dear Mousey; but it was quite
      different when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he came back from seeing you. You know you always had the
      art of stilling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">any person's trouble. You and my aunt Buxton are the only
      two I ever knew</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with that gift."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am so sorry he has any trouble to be stilled," said
      Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And I think it will do him a world of good. Think how
      successful his life</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has been! the honors he got at Eton! his picture taken, and
      I don't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">know what! and at Cambridge just the same way of going on.
      He would be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">insufferably imperious in a few years, if he did not meet
      with a few</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">crosses."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Imperious!--oh Erminia, how can you say so?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Because it's the truth. He happens to have very good
      dispositions; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">therefore his strong will is not either disagreeable, or
      offensive; but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">once let him become possessed by a wrong wish, and you
      would then see how</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">vehement and imperious he would be. Depend upon it, my
      uncle's resistance</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is a capital thing for him. As dear sweet Aunt Buxton would
      have said,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">'There is a holy purpose in it;' and as Aunt Buxton would
      not have said,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but as I, a 'fool, rush in where angels fear to tread,' I
      decide that the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">purpose is to teach Master Frank patience and
      submission."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Erminia--how could you help"--and there Maggie
      stopped.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I know what you mean; how could I help falling in love
      with him? I think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he has not mystery and reserve enough for me. I should like
      a man with some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">deep, impenetrable darkness around him; something one could
      always keep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wondering about. Besides, think what clashing of wills
      there would have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been! My uncle was very short-sighted in his plan; but I
      don't think he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought so much about the fitness of our characters and
      ways, as the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fitness of our fortunes!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"For shame, Erminia! No one cares less for money than Mr.
      Buxton!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There's a good little daughter-in-law elect! But
      seriously, I do think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he is beginning to care for money; not in the least for
      himself, but as a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">means of aggrandizement for Frank. I have observed, since I
      came home at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Christmas, a growing anxiety to make the most of his
      property; a thing he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never cared about before. I don't think he is aware of it
      himself, but from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one or two little things I have noticed, I should not
      wonder if he ends in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">being avaricious in his old age." Erminia sighed.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie had almost a sympathy with the father, who sought
      what he imagined</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to be for the good of his son, and that son, Frank.
      Although she was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as convinced as Erminia, that money could not really help
      any one to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">happiness, she could not at the instant resist saying:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh! how I wish I had a fortune! I should so like to give
      it all to him."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Now Maggie! don't be silly! I never heard you wish for
      anything different</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from what <i>was</i> before, so I shall take
      this opportunity of lecturing you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on your folly. No! I won't either, for you look sadly tired
      with all your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">agitation; and besides I must go, or Jem will be wondering
      what has become</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of me. Dearest cousin-in-law, I shall come very often to
      see you; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">perhaps I shall give you my lecture yet."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER VI.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was true of Mr. Buxton, as well as of his son, that he
      had the seeds of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">imperiousness in him. His life had not been such as to call
      them out into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">view. With more wealth than he required; with a gentle
      wife, who if she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ruled him never showed it, or was conscious of the fact
      herself; looked up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to by his neighbors, a simple affectionate set of people,
      whose fathers</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had lived near his father and grandfather in the same
      kindly relation,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">receiving benefits cordially given, and requiting them with
      good will and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">respectful attention: such had been the circumstances
      surrounding him; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">until his son grew out of childhood, there had not seemed a
      wish which he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had it not in his power to gratify as soon as formed.
      Again, when Frank was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at school and at college, all went on prosperously; he
      gained honors enough</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to satisfy a far more ambitious father. Indeed, it was the
      honors he gained</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that stimulated his father's ambition. He received letters
      from tutors,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and headmasters, prophesying that, if Frank chose, he might
      rise to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"highest honors in church or state;" and the idea thus
      suggested, vague as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it was, remained, and filled Mr. Buxton's mind; and, for
      the first time in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his life, made him wish that his own career had been such
      as would have led</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him to form connections among the great and powerful. But,
      as it was, his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shyness and <i>g&ecirc;ne</i>, from being
      unaccustomed to society, had made him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">averse to Frank's occasional requests that he might bring
      such and such a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">school-fellow, or college-chum, home on a visit. Now he
      regretted this, on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">account of the want of those connections which might thus
      have been formed;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and, in his visions, he turned to marriage as the best way
      of remedying</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this. Erminia was right in saying that her uncle had
      thought of Lady Adela</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Castlemayne for an instant; though how the little witch had
      found it out I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cannot say, as the idea had been dismissed immediately from
      his mind.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He was wise enough to see its utter vanity, as long as his
      son remained</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">undistinguished. But his hope was this. If Frank married
      Erminia, their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">united property (she being her father's heiress) would
      justify him in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">standing for the shire; or if he could marry the daughter
      of some leading</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">personage in the county, it might lead to the same step;
      and thus at once</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he would obtain a position in parliament, where his great
      talents would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have scope and verge enough. Of these two visions, the
      favorite one (for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his sister's sake) was that of marriage with Erminia.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And, in the midst of all this, fell, like a bombshell, the
      intelligence of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his engagement with Maggie Browne; a good sweet little girl
      enough, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">without fortune or connection--without, as far as Mr.
      Buxton knew, the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">least power, or capability, or spirit, with which to help
      Frank on in his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">career to eminence in the land! He resolved to consider if
      as a boyish</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fancy, easily to be suppressed; and pooh-poohed it down, to
      Frank,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accordingly. He remarked his son's set lips, and quiet
      determined brow,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">although he never spoke in a more respectful tone, than
      while thus steadily</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">opposing his father. If he had shown more violence of
      manner, he would have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">irritated him less; but, as it was, if was the most
      miserable interview</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that had ever taken place between the father and son.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton tried to calm himself down with believing that
      Frank would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">change his mind, if he saw more of the world; but, somehow,
      he had a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">prophesying distrust of this idea internally. The worst
      was, there was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">no fault to be found with Maggie herself, although she
      might want the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accomplishments he desired to see in his son's wife. Her
      connections, too,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were so perfectly respectable (though humble enough in
      comparison with Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's soaring wishes), that there was nothing to be
      objected to on that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">score; her position was the great offence. In proportion to
      his want of any</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">reason but this one, for disapproving of the engagement,
      was his annoyance</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">under it. He assumed a reserve toward Frank; which was so
      unusual a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">restraint upon his open, genial disposition, that it seemed
      to make him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">irritable toward all others in contact with him, excepting
      Erminia. He</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">found it difficult to behave rightly to Maggie. Like all
      habitually cordial</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">persons, he went into the opposite extreme, when he wanted
      to show a little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coolness. However angry he might be with the events of
      which she was the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cause, she was too innocent and meek to justify him in
      being more than</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cool; but his awkwardness was so great, that many a man of
      the world has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">met his greatest enemy, each knowing the other's hatred,
      with less freezing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">distance of manner than Mr. Buxton's to Maggie. While she
      went simply on in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her own path, loving him the more through all, for old
      kindness' sake, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">because he was Frank's father, he shunned meeting her with
      such evident and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">painful anxiety, that at last she tried to spare him the
      encounter, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hurried out of church, or lingered behind all, in order to
      avoid the only</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">chance they now had of being forced to speak; for she no
      longer went to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dear house in Combehurst, though Erminia came to see her
      more than ever.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne was perplexed and annoyed beyond measure. She
      upbraided Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton to every one but Maggie. To her she said--"Any one
      in their senses</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">might have foreseen what had happened, and would have
      thought well about</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it, before they went and fell in love with a young man of
      such expectations</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as Mr. Frank Buxton."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">In the middle of all this dismay, Edward came over from
      Woodchester for a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">day or two. He had been told of the engagement, in a letter
      from Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself; but if was too sacred a subject for her to enlarge
      upon to him;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Browne was no letter writer. So this was his first
      greeting to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie; after kissing her:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well, Sancho, you've done famously for yourself. As soon
      as I got your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">letter I said to Harry Bish--'Still waters run deep; here's
      my little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sister Maggie, as quiet a creature as ever lived, has
      managed to catch</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">young Buxton, who has five thousand a-year if he's a
      penny.' Don't go so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">red, Maggie. Harry was sure to hear of if soon from some
      one, and I see no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">use in keeping it secret, for it gives consequence to us
      all."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Buxton is quite put out about it," said Mrs. Brown,
      querulously; "and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I'm sure he need not be, for he's enough of money, if
      that's what he wants;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and Maggie's father was a clergyman, and I've seen
      'yeoman,' with my own</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">eyes, on old Mr. Buxton's (Mr. Lawrence's father's) carts;
      and a clergyman</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is above a yeoman any day. But if Maggie had had any
      thought for other</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">people, she'd never have gone and engaged herself, when she
      might have been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sure it would give offence. We are never asked down to
      dinner now. I've</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never broken bread there since last Christmas."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Whew!" said Edward to this. It was a disappointed whistle;
      but he soon</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cheered up. "I thought I could have lent a hand in screwing
      old Buxton up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about the settlements; but I see it's not come to that yet.
      Still I'll go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and see the old gentleman. I'm a bit of a favorite of his,
      and I doubt I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">can turn him round."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Pray, Edward, don't go," said Maggie. "Frank and I are
      content to wait;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and I'm sure we would rather not have any one speak to Mr.
      Buxton, upon a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">subject which evidently gives him so much pain; please,
      Edward, don't!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well, well. Only I must go about this property of his.
      Besides, I don't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mean to get into disgrace; so I shan't seem to know
      anything about it,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if it would make him angry. I want to keep on good terms,
      because of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">agency. So, perhaps, I shall shake my head, and think it
      great presumption</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in you, Maggie, to have thought of becoming his
      daughter-in-law. If I can</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">do you no good, I may as well do myself some."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I hope you won't mention me at all," she replied.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">One comfort (and almost the only one arising from Edward's
      visit) was, that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she could now often be spared to go up to the thorn-tree,
      and calm down her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">anxiety, and bring all discords into peace, under the sweet
      influences of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nature. Mrs. Buxton had tried to teach her the force of the
      lovely truth,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that the "melodies of the everlasting chime" may abide in
      the hearts of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">those who ply their daily task in towns, and crowded
      populous places; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that solitude is not needed by the faithful for them to
      feel the immediate</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">presence of God; nor utter stillness of human sound
      necessary, before they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">can hear the music of His angels' footsteps; but, as yet,
      her soul was a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">young disciple; and she felt it easier to speak to Him, and
      come to Him for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">help, sitting lonely, with wild moors swelling and
      darkening around her,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and not a creature in sight but the white specks of distant
      sheep, and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">birds that shun the haunts of men, floating in the still
      mid-air.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She sometimes longed to go to Mr. Buxton and tell him how
      much she could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sympathize with him, if his dislike to her engagement arose
      from thinking</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her unworthy of his son. Frank's character seemed to her
      grand in its</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">promise. With vehement impulses and natural gifts, craving
      worthy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">employment, his will sat supreme over all, like a young
      emperor calmly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seated on his throne, whose fiery generals and wise
      counsellors stand alike</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ready to obey him. But if marriage were to be made by due
      measurement and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">balance of character, and if others, with their scales,
      were to be the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">judges, what would become of all the beautiful services
      rendered by the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">loyalty of true love? Where would be the raising up of the
      weak by the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">strong? or the patient endurance? or the gracious trust of
      her:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; "Whose faith is fixt and cannot move;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; She darkly feels him great and wise,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; She dwells on him with faithful eyes,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; 'I cannot understand: I love.'"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward's manners and conduct caused her more real anxiety
      than anything</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">else. Indeed, no other thoughtfulness could be called
      anxiety compared to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this. His faults, she could not but perceive, were
      strengthening with his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">strength, and growing with his growth. She could not help
      wondering whence</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he obtained the money to pay for his dress, which she
      thought was of a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very expensive kind. She heard him also incidentally allude
      to "runs up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to town," of which, at the time, neither she nor her mother
      had been made</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">aware. He seemed confused when she questioned him about
      these, although he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tried to laugh it off; and asked her how she, a country
      girl, cooped up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">among one set of people, could have any idea of the life it
      was necessary</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for a man to lead who "had any hope of getting on in the
      world." He must</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have acquaintances and connections, and see something of
      life, and make an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">appearance. She was silenced, but not satisfied. Nor was
      she at ease with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">regard to his health. He looked ill, and worn; and, when he
      was not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rattling and laughing, his face fell into a shape of
      anxiety and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">uneasiness, which was new to her in it. He reminded her
      painfully of an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">old German engraving she had seen in Mrs. Buxton's
      portfolio, called,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Pleasure digging a Grave;" Pleasure being represented by a
      ghastly figure</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of a young man, eagerly industrious over his dismal
      work.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">A few days after he went away, Nancy came to her in her
      bed-room.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Miss Maggie," said she, "may I just speak a word?" But
      when the permission</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was given, she hesitated.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It's none of my business, to be sure," said she at last:
      "only, you see,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I've lived with your mother ever since she was married; and
      I care a deal</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for both you and Master Edward. And I think he drains
      Missus of her money;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and it makes me not easy in my mind. You did not know of
      it, but he had his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father's old watch when he was over last time but one; I
      thought he was of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">an age to have a watch, and that it was all natural. But, I
      reckon he's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sold it, and got that gimcrack one instead. That's perhaps
      natural too.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Young folks like young fashions. But, this time, I think he
      has taken away</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">your mother's watch; at least, I've never seen it since he
      went. And this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">morning she spoke to me about my wages. I'm sure I've never
      asked for them,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nor troubled her; but I'll own it's now near on to twelve
      months since she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">paid me; and she was as regular as clock-work till then.
      Now, Miss Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">don't look so sorry, or I shall wish I had never spoken.
      Poor Missus seemed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sadly put about, and said something as I did not try to
      hear; for I was so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">vexed she should think I needed apologies, and them sort of
      things. I'd</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rather live with you without wages than have her look so
      shame-faced as she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">did this morning. I don't want a bit for money, my dear;
      I've a deal in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Bank. But I'm afeard Master Edward is spending too much,
      and pinching</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Missus."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was very sorry indeed. Her mother had never told her
      anything of all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this, so it was evidently a painful subject to her; and
      Maggie determined</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">(after lying awake half the night) that she would write to
      Edward, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remonstrate with him; and that in every personal and
      household expense, she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would be, more than ever, rigidly economical.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The full, free, natural intercourse between her lover and
      herself, could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not fail to be checked by Mr. Buxton's aversion to the
      engagement. Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came over for some time in the early autumn. He had left
      Cambridge, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intended to enter himself at the Temple as soon as the
      vacation was ended.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He had not been very long at home before Maggie was made
      aware, partly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">through Erminia, who had no notion of discreet silence on
      any point, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">partly by her own observation, of the increasing
      estrangement between</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father and son. Mr. Buxton was reserved with Frank for the
      first time in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his life; and Frank was depressed and annoyed at his
      father's obstinate</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">repetition of the same sentence, in answer to all his
      arguments in favor of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his engagement--arguments which were overwhelming to
      himself and which it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">required an effort of patience on his part to go over and
      recapitulate, so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">obvious was the conclusion; and then to have the same
      answer forever, the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">same words even:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Frank! it's no use talking. I don't approve of the
      engagement; and never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shall."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He would snatch up his hat, and hurry off to Maggie to be
      soothed. His</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father knew where he was gone without being told; and was
      jealous of her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">influence over the son who had long been his first and
      paramount object in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">life.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He needed not have been jealous. However angry and
      indignant Frank was when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he went up to the moorland cottage, Maggie almost persuaded
      him, before</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">half an hour had elapsed, that his father was but
      unreasonable from his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">extreme affection. Still she saw that such frequent
      differences would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">weaken the bond between father and son; and, accordingly,
      she urged Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to accept an invitation into Scotland.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You told me," said she, "that Mr. Buxton will have it, it
      is but a boy's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">attachment; and that when you have seen other people, you
      will change your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mind; now do try how far you can stand the effects of
      absence." She said it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">playfully, but he was in a humor to be vexed.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What nonsense, Maggie! You don't care for all this delay
      yourself; and you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">take up my father's bad reasons as if you believed
      them."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't believe them; but still they may be true."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"How should you like it, Maggie, if I urged you to go about
      and see</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something of society, and try if you could not find some
      one you liked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">better? It is more probable in your case than in mine; for
      you have never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been from home, and I have been half over Europe."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You are very much afraid, are not you, Frank?" said she,
      her face bright</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with blushes, and her gray eyes smiling up at him. "I have
      a great idea</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that if I could see that Harry Bish that Edward is always
      talking about, I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">should be charmed. He must wear such beautiful waistcoats!
      Don't you think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I had better see him before our engagement is quite, quite
      final?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But Frank would not smile. In fact, like all angry persons,
      he found fresh</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">matter for offence in every sentence. She did not consider
      the engagement</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as quite final: thus he chose to understand her playful
      speech. He would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not answer. She spoke again:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dear Frank, you are not angry with me, are you? It is
      nonsense to think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that we are to go about the world, picking and choosing men
      and women as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if they were fruit and we were to gather the best; as if
      there was not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something in our own hearts which, if we listen to it
      conscientiously, will</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tell us at once when we have met the one of all others.
      There now, am I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sensible? I suppose I am, for your grim features are
      relaxing into a smile.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">That's right. But now listen to this. I think your father
      would come round</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sooner, if he were not irritated every day by the knowledge
      of your visits</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to me. If you went away, he would know that we should write
      to each other</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">yet he would forget the exact time when; but now he knows
      as well as I do</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">where you are when you are up here; and I fancy, from what
      Erminia says, it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">makes him angry the whole time you are away."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank was silent. At last he said: "It is rather provoking
      to be obliged to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">acknowledge that there is some truth in what you say. But
      even if I would,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I am not sure that I could go. My father does not speak to
      me about his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">affairs, as he used to do; so I was rather surprised
      yesterday to hear him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">say to Erminia (though I'm sure he meant the information
      for me), that he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had engaged an agent."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Then there will be the less occasion for you to be at
      home. He won't want</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">your help in his accounts."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I've given him little enough of that. I have long wanted
      him to have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">somebody to look after his affairs. They are very
      complicated and he is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very careless. But I believe my signature will be wanted
      for some new</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">leases; at least he told me so."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"That need not take you long," said Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Not the mere signing. But I want to know something more
      about the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">property, and the proposed tenants. I believe this Mr.
      Henry that my father</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has engaged, is a very hard sort of man. He is what is
      called scrupulously</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">honest and honorable; but I fear a little too much inclined
      to drive hard</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bargains for his client. Now I want to be convinced to the
      contrary, if I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">can, before I leave my father in his hands. So you cruel
      judge, you won't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">transport me yet, will you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No" said Maggie, overjoyed at her own decision, and
      blushing her delight</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that her reason was convinced it was right for Frank to
      stay a little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">longer.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The next day's post brought her a letter from Edward. There
      was not a word</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in it about her inquiry or remonstrance; it might never
      have been written,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or never received; but a few hurried anxious lines, asking
      her to write by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">return of post, and say if it was really true that Mr.
      Buxton had engaged</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">an agent. "It's a confounded shabby trick if he has, after
      what he said to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me long ago. I cannot tell you how much I depend on your
      complying with my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">request. Once more, <i>write directly</i>. If
      Nancy cannot take the letter to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the post, run down to Combehurst with it yourself. I must
      have an answer</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to-morrow, and every particular as to who--when to be
      appointed, &amp;c. But I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">can't believe the report to be true."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie asked Frank if she might name what he had told her
      the day before to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her brother. He said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, yes, certainly, if he cares to know. Of course, you
      will not say</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">anything about my own opinion of Mr. Henry. He is coming
      to-morrow, and I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shall be able to judge how far I am right."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER VII.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The next day Mr. Henry came. He was a quiet, stern-looking
      man, of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">considerable intelligence and refinement, and so much taste
      for music as to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">charm Erminia, who had rather dreaded his visit. But all
      the amenities of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">life were put aside when he entered Mr. Buxton's
      sanctum--his "office," as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he called the room where he received his tenants and
      business people. Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought Mr. Henry was scarce commonly civil in the open
      evidence of his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">surprise and contempt for the habits, of which the
      disorderly books and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ledgers were but too visible signs. Mr. Buxton himself felt
      more like a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">school-boy, bringing up an imperfect lesson, than he had
      ever done since he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was thirteen.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"The only wonder, my good sir, is that you have any
      property left; that you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have not been cheated out of every farthing."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'll answer for it," said Mr. Buxton, in reply, "that
      you'll not find any</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cheating has been going on. They dared not, sir; they know
      I should make an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">example of the first rogue I found out."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Henry lifted up his eyebrows, but did not speak.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Besides, sir, most of these men have lived for generations
      under the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxtons. I'd give you my life, they would not cheat
      me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Henry coldly said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I imagine a close examination of these books by some
      accountant will be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the best proof of the honesty of these said tenants. If you
      will allow me,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I will write to a clever fellow I know, and desire him to
      come down and try</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and regulate this mass of papers."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Anything--anything you like," said Mr. Buxton, only too
      glad to escape</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from the lawyer's cold, contemptuous way of treating the
      subject.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The accountant came; and he and Mr. Henry were deeply
      engaged in the office</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for several days. Mr. Buxton was bewildered by the
      questions they asked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him. Mr. Henry examined him in the worrying way in which an
      unwilling</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">witness is made to give evidence. Many a time and oft did
      he heartily wish</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he had gone on in the old course to the end of his life,
      instead of putting</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">himself into an agent's hands; but he comforted himself by
      thinking that,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at any rate, they would be convinced he had never allowed
      himself to be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cheated or imposed upon, although he did not make any
      parade of exactitude.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">What was his dismay when, one morning, Mr. Henry sent to
      request his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">presence, and, with a cold, clear voice, read aloud an
      admirably drawn up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">statement, informing the poor landlord of the defalcations,
      nay more, the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">impositions of those whom he had trusted. If he had been
      alone, he would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have burst into tears, to find how his confidence had been
      abused. But as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it was, he became passionately angry.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'll prosecute them, sir. Not a man shall escape. I'll
      make them pay back</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">every farthing, I will. And damages, too. Crayston, did you
      say, sir? Was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that one of the names? Why, that is the very Crayston who
      was bailiff under</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">my father for years. The scoundrel! And I set him up in my
      best farm when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he married. And he's been swindling me, has he?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Henry ran over the items of the
      account--"421<i>l</i>, 13<i>s</i>.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">4-3/4<i>d</i>. Part of this I fear we cannot
      recover"----</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He was going on, but Mr. Buxton broke in: "But I will
      recover it. I'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have every farthing of it. I'll go to law with the viper. I
      don't care for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">money, but I hate ingratitude."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If you like, I will take counsel's opinion on the case,"
      said Mr. Henry,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coolly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Take anything you please, sir. Why this Crayston was the
      first man that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">set me on a horse--and to think of his cheating me!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">A few days after this conversation, Frank came on his usual
      visit to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Can you come up to the thorn-tree, dearest?" said he. "It
      is a lovely day,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and I want the solace of a quiet hour's talk with you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">So they went, and sat in silence some time, looking at the
      calm and still</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">blue air about the summits of the hills, where never tumult
      of the world</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came to disturb the peace, and the quiet of whose heights
      was never broken</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by the loud passionate cries of men.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am glad you like my thorn-tree," said Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I like the view from it. The thought of the solitude which
      must be among</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the hollows of those hills pleases me particularly to-day.
      Oh, Maggie! it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is one of the times when I get depressed about men and the
      world. We have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had such sorrow, and such revelations, and remorse, and
      passion at home</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to-day. Crayston (my father's old tenant) has come over. It
      seems--I am</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">afraid there is no doubt of it--he has been peculating to a
      large amount.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">My father has been too careless, and has placed his
      dependents in great</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">temptation; and Crayston--he is an old man, with a large
      extravagant</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">family--has yielded. He has been served with notice of my
      father's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intention to prosecute him; and came over to confess all,
      and ask for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">forgiveness, and time to pay back what he could. A month
      ago, my father</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would have listened to him, I think; but now, he is stung
      by Mr. Henry's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sayings, and gave way to a furious passion. It has been a
      most distressing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">morning. The worst side of everybody seems to have come
      out. Even Crayston,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with all his penitence and appearance of candor, had to be
      questioned</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">closely by Mr. Henry before he would tell the whole truth.
      Good God! that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">money should have such power to corrupt men. It was all for
      money, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">money's worth, that this degradation has taken place. As
      for Mr. Henry, to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">save his client money, and to protect money, he does not
      care--he does</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not even perceive--how he induces deterioration of
      character. He has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been encouraging my father in measures which I cannot call
      anything but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">vindictive. Crayston is to be made an example of, they say.
      As if my father</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had not half the sin on his own head! As if he had rightly
      discharged his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">duties as a rich man! Money was as dross to him; but he
      ought to have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remembered how it might be as life itself to many, and be
      craved after, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coveted, till the black longing got the better of
      principle, as it has done</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with this poor Crayston. They say the man was once so
      truthful, and now his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">self-respect is gone; and he has evidently lost the very
      nature of truth. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dread riches. I dread the responsibility of them. At any
      rate, I wish I had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">begun life as a poor boy, and worked my way up to
      competence. Then I could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">understand and remember the temptations of poverty. I am
      afraid of my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">own heart becoming hardened as my father's is. You have no
      notion of his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">passionate severity to-day, Maggie! It was quite a new
      thing even to me!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It will only be for a short time," said she. "He must be
      much grieved</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about this man."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If I thought I could ever grow as hard and different to
      the abject</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">entreaties of a criminal as my father has been this
      morning--one whom he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has helped to make, too--I would go off to Australia at
      once. Indeed,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie, I think it would be the best thing we could do. My
      heart aches</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about the mysterious corruptions and evils of an old state
      of society such</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as we have in England.--What do you say Maggie? Would you
      go?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She was silent--thinking.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I would go with you directly, if it were right," said she,
      at last. "But</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would it be? I think it would be rather cowardly. I feel
      what you say; but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">don't you think it would be braver to stay, and endure much
      depression and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">anxiety of mind, for the sake of the good those always can
      do who see evils</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">clearly. I am speaking all this time as if neither you nor
      I had any home</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">duties, but were free to do as me liked."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What can you or I do? We are less than drops in the ocean,
      as far as our</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">influence can go to model a nation?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"As for that," said Maggie, laughing, "I can't remodel
      Nancy's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">old-fashioned ways; so I've never yet planned how to
      remodel a nation."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Then what did you mean by the good those always can do who
      see evils</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">clearly? The evils I see are those of a nation whose god is
      money."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"That is just because you have come away from a distressing
      scene.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">To-morrow you will hear or read of some heroic action
      meeting with a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nation's sympathy, and you will rejoice and be proud of
      your country."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Still I shall see the evils of her complex state of
      society keenly; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">where is the good I can do?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh! I can't tell in a minute. But cannot you bravely face
      these evils,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and learn their nature and causes; and then has God given
      you no powers to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">apply to the discovery of their remedy? Dear Frank, think!
      It may be very</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little you can do--and you may never see the effect of it,
      any more than</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the widow saw the world-wide effect of her mite. Then if
      all the good and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thoughtful men run away from us to some new country, what
      are we to do with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">our poor dear Old England?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, you must run away with the good, thoughtful men--(I
      mean to consider</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that as a compliment to myself, Maggie!) Will you let me
      wish I had been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">born poor, if I am to stay in England? I should not then be
      liable to this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fault into which I see the rich men fall, of forgetting the
      trials of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">poor."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am not sure whether, if you had been poor, you might not
      have fallen</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">into an exactly parallel fault, and forgotten the trials of
      the rich. It is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so difficult to understand the errors into which their
      position makes all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">men liable to fall. Do you remember a story in 'Evenings at
      Home,' called</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the Transmigrations of Indra? Well! when I was a child, I
      used to wish I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">might be transmigrated (is that the right word?) into an
      American</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">slave-owner for a little while, just that I might
      understand how he must</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suffer, and be sorely puzzled, and pray and long to be
      freed from his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">odious wealth, till at last he grew hardened to its
      nature;--and since</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">then, I have wished to be the Emperor of Russia, for the
      same reason. Ah!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you may laugh; but that is only because I have not
      explained myself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">properly."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I was only smiling to think how ambitious any one might
      suppose you were</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">who did not know you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't see any ambition in it--I don't think of the
      station--I only want</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sorely to see the 'What's resisted' of Burns, in order that
      I may have more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">charity for those who seem to me to have been the cause of
      such infinite</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">woe and misery."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; "'What's done we partly may compute;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; But know not what's resisted,'"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">repeated Frank musingly. After some time he began
      again:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But, Maggie, I don't give up this wish of mine to go to
      Australia--Canada,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">if you like it better--anywhere where there is a newer and
      purer state of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">society."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"The great objection seems to be your duty, as an only
      child, to your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father. It is different to the case of one out of a large
      family."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wish I were one in twenty, then I might marry where I
      liked to-morrow."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It would take two people's consent to such a rapid
      measure," said Maggie,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">laughing. "But now I am going to wish a wish, which it
      won't require a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fairy godmother to gratify. Look, Frank, do you see in the
      middle of that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dark brown purple streak of moor a yellow gleam of light?
      It is a pond, I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think, that at this time of the year catches a slanting
      beam of the sun. It</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cannot be very far off. I have wished to go to it every
      autumn. Will you go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with me now? We shall have time before tea."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank's dissatisfaction with the stern measures that, urged
      on by Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Henry, his father took against all who had imposed upon his
      carelessness as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a landlord, increased rather than diminished. He spoke
      warmly to him on the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">subject, but without avail. He remonstrated with Mr. Henry,
      and told him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">how he felt that, had his father controlled his careless
      nature, and been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">an exact, vigilant landlord, these tenantry would never
      have had the great</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">temptation to do him wrong; and that therefore he
      considered some allowance</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">should be made for them, and some opportunity given them to
      redeem their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">characters, which would be blasted and hardened for ever by
      the publicity</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of a law-suit. But Mr. Henry only raised his eyebrows and
      made answer:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I like to see these notions in a young man, sir. I had
      them myself at your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">age. I believe I had great ideas then, on the subject of
      temptation and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the force of circumstances; and was as Quixotic as any one
      about reforming</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rogues. But my experience has convinced me that roguery is
      innate. Nothing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but outward force can control it, and keep it within
      bounds. The terrors of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the law must be that outward force. I admire your kindness
      of heart; and in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">three-and-twenty we do not look for the wisdom and
      experience of forty or</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fifty."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank was indignant at being set aside as an unripe youth.
      He disapproved</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so strongly of all these measures, and of so much that was
      now going on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at home under Mr. Henry's influence that he determined to
      pay his long</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">promised visit to Scotland; and Maggie, sad at heart to see
      how he was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suffering, encouraged him in his determination.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER VIII.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">After he was gone, there came a November of the most dreary
      and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">characteristic kind. There was incessant rain, and
      closing-in mists,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">without a gleam of sunshine to light up the drops of water,
      and make the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wet stems and branches of the trees glisten. Every color
      seemed dimmed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and darkened; and the crisp autumnal glory of leaves fell
      soddened to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ground. The latest flowers rotted away without ever coming
      to their bloom;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and it looked as if the heavy monotonous sky had drawn
      closer and closer,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and shut in the little moorland cottage as with a shroud.
      In doors, things</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were no more cheerful. Maggie saw that her mother was
      depressed, and she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought that Edward's extravagance must be the occasion.
      Oftentimes she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wondered how far she might speak on the subject; and once
      or twice she drew</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">near it in conversation; but her mother winced away, and
      Maggie could not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as yet see any decided good to be gained from encountering
      such pain. To</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself it would have been a relief to have known the
      truth--the worst,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as far as her mother knew it; but she was not in the habit
      of thinking of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself. She only tried, by long tender attention, to cheer
      and comfort</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her mother; and she and Nancy strove in every way to reduce
      the household</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">expenditure, for there was little ready money to meet it.
      Maggie wrote</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">regularly to Edward; but since the note inquiring about the
      agency, she had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never heard from him. Whether her mother received letters
      she did not know;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">but at any rate she did not express anxiety, though her
      looks and manner</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">betrayed that she was ill at ease. It was almost a relief
      to Maggie when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some change was given to her thoughts by Nancy's becoming
      ill. The damp</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gloomy weather brought on some kind of rheumatic attack,
      which obliged the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">old servant to keep her bed. Formerly, in such an
      emergency, they would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have engaged some cottager's wife to come and do the
      house-work; but now it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seemed tacitly understood that they could not afford it.
      Even when Nancy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">grew worse, and required attendance in the night, Maggie
      still persisted in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her daily occupations. She was wise enough to rest when and
      how she could;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and, with a little forethought, she hoped to be able to go
      through this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">weary time without any bad effect. One morning (it was on
      the second of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">December; and even the change of name in the month,
      although it brought no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">change of circumstances or weather, was a relief--December
      brought glad</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tidings even in its very name), one morning, dim and
      dreary, Maggie had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looked at the clock on leaving Nancy's room, and finding it
      was not yet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">half-past five, and knowing that her mother and Nancy were
      both asleep, she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">determined to lie down and rest for an hour before getting
      up to light the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fires. She did not mean to go to sleep; but she was tired
      out and fell into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a sound slumber. When she awoke it was with a start. It was
      still dark; but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she had a clear idea of being wakened by some distinct,
      rattling noise.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">There it was once more--against the window, like a shower
      of shot. She</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">went to the lattice, and opened it to look out. She had
      that strange</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">consciousness, not to be described, of the near
      neighborhood of some human</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">creature, although she neither saw nor heard any one for
      the first instant.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Then Edward spoke in a hoarse whisper, right below the
      window, standing on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the flower-beds.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie! Maggie! Come down and let me in. For your life,
      don't make any</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">noise. No one must know."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie turned sick. Something was wrong, evidently; and she
      was weak and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">weary. However, she stole down the old creaking stairs, and
      undid the heavy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bolt, and let her brother in. She felt that his dress was
      quite wet, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she led him, with cautious steps, into the kitchen, and
      shut the door, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stirred the fire, before she spoke. He sank into a chair,
      as if worn out</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with fatigue. She stood, expecting some explanation. But
      when she saw he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">could not speak, she hastened to make him a cup of tea;
      and, stooping down,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">took off his wet boots, and helped him off with his coat,
      and brought her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">own plaid to wrap round him. All this time her heart sunk
      lower and lower.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He allowed her to do what she liked, as if he were an
      automaton; his head</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and his arms hung loosely down, and his eyes were fixed, in
      a glaring way,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on the fire. When she brought him some tea, he spoke for
      the first time;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she could not hear what he said till he repeated it, so
      husky was his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">voice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Have you no brandy?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She had the key of the little wine-cellar, and fetched up
      some. But as she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">took a tea-spoon to measure if out, he tremblingly clutched
      at the bottle,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and shook down a quantity into the empty tea-cup, and drank
      it off at one</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gulp. He fell back again in his chair; but in a few minutes
      he roused</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">himself, and seemed stronger.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Edward, dear Edward, what is the matter?" said Maggie, at
      last; for he got</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up, and was staggering toward the outer door, as if he were
      going once more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">into the rain, and dismal morning-twilight.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He looked at her fiercely as she laid her hand on his
      arm.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Confound you! Don't touch me. I'll not be kept here, to be
      caught and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hung!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">For an instant she thought he was mad.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Caught and hung!" she echoed. "My poor Edward! what do you
      mean?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He sat down suddenly on a chair, close by him, and covered
      his face with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his hands. When he spoke, his voice was feeble and
      imploring.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"The police are after me, Maggie! What must I do? Oh! can
      you hide me? Can</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you save me?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He looked wild, like a hunted creature. Maggie stood
      aghast. He went on:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My mother!--Nancy! Where are they? I was wet through and
      starving, and I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came here. Don't let them take me, Maggie, till I'm
      stronger, and can give</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">battle."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh! Edward! Edward! What are you saying?" said Maggie,
      sitting down on the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dresser, in absolute, bewildered despair. "What have you
      done?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I hardly know. I'm in a horrid dream. I see you think I'm
      mad. I wish I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were. Won't Nancy come down soon? You must hide me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Poor Nancy is ill in bed!" said Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Thank God," said he. "There's one less. But my mother will
      be up soon,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will she not?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Not yet," replied Maggie. "Edward, dear, do try and tell
      me what you have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">done. Why should the police be after you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why, Maggie," said he with a kind of forced, unnatural
      laugh, "they say</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I've forged."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And have you?" asked Maggie, in a still, low tone of quiet
      agony.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He did not answer for some time, but sat, looking on the
      floor with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">unwinking eyes. At last he said, as if speaking to
      himself:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If I have, it's no more than others have done before, and
      never been found</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">out. I was but borrowing money. I meant to repay it. If I
      had asked Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton, he would have lent it me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Buxton!" said Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes!" answered he, looking sharply and suddenly up at her.
      "Your future</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father-in-law. My father's old friend. It is he that is
      hunting me to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">death! No need to look so white and horror-struck, Maggie!
      It's the way of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the world, as I might have known, if I had not been a blind
      fool."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Buxton!" she whispered, faintly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, Maggie!" said he, suddenly throwing himself at her
      feet, "save me! You</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">can do it. Write to Frank, and make him induce his father
      to let me off. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came to see you, my sweet, merciful sister! I knew you
      would save me. Good</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">God! What noise is that? There are steps in the yard!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And before she could speak, he had rushed into the little
      china closet,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which opened out of the parlor, and crouched down in the
      darkness. It was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">only the man who brought their morning's supply of milk
      from a neighboring</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">farm. But when Maggie opened the kitchen door, she saw how
      the cold, pale</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">light of a winter's day had filled the air.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You're late with your shutters to-day, miss," said the
      man. "I hope Nancy</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has not been giving you all a bad night. Says I to Thomas,
      who came with me</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to the gate, 'It's many a year since I saw them parlor
      shutters barred up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at half-past eight.'"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie went, as soon as he was gone, and opened all the low
      windows, in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">order that they might look as usual. She wondered at her
      own outward</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">composure, while she felt so dead and sick at heart. Her
      mother would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">soon get up; must she be told? Edward spoke to her now and
      then from his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hiding-place. He dared not go back into the kitchen, into
      which the few</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">neighbors they had were apt to come, on their morning's way
      to Combehurst,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to ask if they could do any errands there for Mrs. Browne
      or Nancy. Perhaps</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a quarter of an hour or so had elapsed since the first
      alarm, when, as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was trying to light the parlor fire, in order that
      the doctor, when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he came, might find all as usual, she heard the click of
      the garden gate,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and a man's step coming along the walk. She ran up stairs
      to wash away the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">traces of the tears which had been streaming down her face
      as she went</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about her work, before she opened the door. There, against
      the watery light</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the rainy day without, stood Mr. Buxton. He hardly spoke
      to her, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pushed past her, and entered the parlor. He sat down,
      looking as if he did</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not know what he was doing. Maggie tried to keep down her
      shivering alarm.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was long since she had seen him; and the old idea of his
      kind, genial</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">disposition, had been sadly disturbed by what she had heard
      from Frank, of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his severe proceedings against his unworthy tenantry; and
      now, if he was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">setting the police in search of Edward, he was indeed to be
      dreaded; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with Edward so close at hand, within earshot! If the china
      fell! He would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suspect nothing from that; it would only be her own terror.
      If her mother</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came down! But, with all these thoughts, she was very
      still, outwardly, as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she sat waiting for him to speak.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Have you heard from your brother lately?" asked he,
      looking up in an angry</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and disturbed manner. "But I'll answer for it he has not
      been writing home</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for some time. He could not, with the guilt he has had on
      his mind. I'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not believe in gratitude again. There perhaps was such a
      thing once; but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">now-a-days the more you do for a person, the surer they are
      to turn against</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you, and cheat you. Now, don't go white and pale. I know
      you're a good girl</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in the main; and I've been lying awake all night, and I've
      a deal to say to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you. That scoundrel of a brother of yours!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie could not ask (as would have been natural, if she
      had been ignorant)</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what Edward had done. She knew too well. But Mr. Buxton was
      too full of his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">own thoughts and feelings to notice her much.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Do you know he has been like the rest? Do you know he has
      been cheating</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me--forging my name? I don't know what besides. It's well
      for him that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">they've altered the laws, and he can't be hung for it" (a
      dead heavy weight</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was removed from Maggie's mind), "but Mr. Henry is going to
      transport him.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It's worse than Crayston. Crayston only ploughed up the
      turf, and did not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pay rent, and sold the timber, thinking I should never miss
      it. But your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">brother has gone and forged my name He had received all the
      purchase-money,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">while he only gave me half, and said the rest was to come
      afterward. And</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the ungrateful scoundrel has gone and given a forged
      receipt! You might</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have knocked me down with a straw when Mr. Henry told me
      about it all last</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">night. 'Never talk to me of virtue and such humbug again,'
      I said, 'I'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">never believe in them. Every one is for what he can get.'
      However, Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Henry wrote to the superintendent of police at Woodchester;
      and has gone</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">over himself this morning to see after it. But to think of
      your father</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">having such a son!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh my poor father!" sobbed out Maggie. "How glad I am you
      are dead before</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this disgrace came upon us!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You may well say disgrace. You're a good girl yourself,
      Maggie. I have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">always said that. How Edward has turned out as he has done,
      I cannot</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">conceive. But now, Maggie, I've something to say to you."
      He moved uneasily</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about, as if he did not know how to begin. Maggie was
      standing leaning her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">head against the chimney-piece, longing for her visitor to
      go, dreading the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">next minute, and wishing to shrink into some dark corner of
      oblivion where</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she might forget all for a time, till she regained a small
      portion of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bodily strength that had been sorely tried of late. Mr.
      Buxton saw her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">white look of anguish, and read it in part, but not wholly.
      He was too</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">intent on what he was going to say.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I've been lying awake all night, thinking. You see the
      disgrace it is to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you, though you are innocent; and I'm sure you can't think
      of involving</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank in it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie went to the little sofa, and, kneeling down by it,
      hid her face in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the cushions. He did not go on, for he thought she was not
      listening to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him. At last he said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Come now, be a sensible girl, and face it out. I've a plan
      to propose."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I hear," said she, in a dull veiled voice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why, you know how against this engagement I have always
      been. Frank is but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">three-and-twenty, and does not know his own mind, as I tell
      him. Besides,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he might marry any one he chose."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He has chosen me," murmured Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Of course, of course. But you'll not think of keeping him
      to it, after</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what has passed. You would not have such a fine fellow as
      Frank pointed at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as the brother-in-law of a forger, would you? It was far
      from what I wished</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for him before; but now! Why you're glad your father is
      dead, rather than</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he should have lived to see this day; and rightly too, I
      think. And you'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not go and disgrace Frank. From what Mr. Henry hears,
      Edward has been a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">discredit to you in many ways. Mr. Henry was at Woodchester
      yesterday, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he says if Edward has been fairly entered as an attorney,
      his name may be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">struck off the Rolls for many a thing he has done. Think of
      my Frank having</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his bright name tarnished by any connection with such a
      man! Mr. Henry</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">says, even in a court of law what has come out about Edward
      would be excuse</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">enough for a breach of promise of marriage."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie lifted up her wan face; the pupils of her eyes were
      dilated, her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lips were dead white. She looked straight at Mr. Buxton
      with indignant</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">impatience:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Henry! Mr. Henry! What has Mr. Henry to do with
      me?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton was staggered by the wild, imperious look, so
      new upon her mild,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sweet face. But he was resolute for Frank's sake, and
      returned to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">charge after a moment's pause.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Henry is a good friend of mine, who has my interest at
      heart. He has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">known what a subject of regret your engagement has been to
      me; though</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">really my repugnance to it was without cause formerly,
      compared to what it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is now. Now be reasonable, my dear. I'm willing to do
      something for you if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you will do something for me. You must see what a stop this
      sad affair has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">put to any thoughts between you and Frank. And you must see
      what cause I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have to wish to punish Edward for his ungrateful behavior,
      to say nothing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the forgery. Well now! I don't know what Mr. Henry will
      say to me, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I have thought of this. If you'll write a letter to Frank,
      just saying</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">distinctly that, for reasons which must for ever remain a
      secret..."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Remain a secret from Frank?" said Maggie, again lifting up
      her head.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why? my dear! You startle me with that manner of
      yours--just let me finish</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">out my sentence. If you'll say that, for reasons which must
      forever remain</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a secret, you decidedly and unchangeably give up all
      connection, all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">engagement with him (which, in fact, Edward's conduct has
      as good as put an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">end to), I'll go over to Woodchester and tell Mr. Henry and
      the police that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">they need not make further search after Edward, for that I
      won't appear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">against him. You can save your brother; and you'll do
      yourself no harm by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">writing this letter, for of course you see your engagement
      is broken off.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">For you never would wish to disgrace Frank."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He paused, anxiously awaiting her reply. She did not
      speak.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'm sure, if I appear against him, he is as good as
      transported," he put</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in, after a while.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Just at this time there was a little sound of displaced
      china in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">closet. Mr. Buxton did not attend to it, but Maggie heard
      it. She got up,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and stood quite calm before Mr. Buxton.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You must go," said she. "I know you; and I know you are
      not aware of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cruel way in which you have spoken to me, while asking me
      to give up the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very hope and marrow of my life"--she could not go on for a
      moment; she was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">choked up with anguish.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It was the truth, Maggie," said he, somewhat abashed.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It was the truth that made the cruelty of it. But you did
      not mean to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">speak cruelly to me, I know. Only it is hard all at once to
      be called upon</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to face the shame and blasted character of one who was once
      an innocent</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">child at the same father's knee."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I may have spoken too plainly," said Mr. Buxton, "but it
      was necessary</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to set the plain truth before you, for my son's sake. You
      will write the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">letter I ask?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Her look was wandering and uncertain. Her attention was
      distracted by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sounds which to him had no meaning; and her judgment she
      felt was wavering</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and disturbed.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I cannot tell. Give me time to think; you will do that,
      I'm sure. Go now,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and leave me alone. If it is right, God will give me
      strength to do it, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">perhaps He will comfort me in my desolation. But I do not
      know--I cannot</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tell. I must have time to think. Go now, if you please,
      sir," said she,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">imploringly.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am sure you will see it is a right thing I ask of you,"
      he persisted.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Go now," she repeated.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Very well. In two hours, I will come back again; for your
      sake, time is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">precious. Even while we speak he may be arrested. At
      eleven, I will come</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">back."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He went away, leaving her sick and dizzy with the effort to
      be calm and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">collected enough to think. She had forgotten for the moment
      how near Edward</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was; and started when she saw the closet-door open, and his
      face put out.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Is he gone? I thought he never would go. What a time you
      kept him, Maggie!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I was so afraid, once, you might sit down to write the
      letter in this room;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and then I knew he would stop and worry you with
      interruptions and advice,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so that it would never be ended; and my back was almost
      broken. But you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sent him off famously. Why, Maggie! Maggie!--you're not
      going to faint,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">surely!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">His sudden burst out of a whisper into a loud exclamation
      of surprise,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">made her rally; but she could not stand. She tried to
      smile, for he really</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looked frightened.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I have been sitting up for many nights--and now this
      sorrow!" Her smile</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">died away into a wailing, feeble cry.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well, well! it's over now, you see. I was frightened
      enough myself this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">morning, I own; and then you were brave and kind. But I
      knew you could save</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me, all along."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">At this moment the door opened, and Mrs. Browne came
      in.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why, Edward, dear! who would have thought of seeing you!
      This is good of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you; what a pleasant surprise! I often said, you might come
      over for a day</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from Woodchester. What's the matter, Maggie, you look so
      fagged? She's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">losing all her beauty, is not she, Edward? Where's
      breakfast? I thought I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">should find all ready. What's the matter? Why don't you
      speak?" said she,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">growing anxious at their silence. Maggie left the
      explanation to Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mother," said he, "I've been rather a naughty boy, and got
      into some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">trouble; but Maggie is going to help me out of it, like a
      good sister."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What is it?" said Mrs. Browne, looking bewildered and
      uneasy.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh--I took a little liberty with our friend Mr. Buxton's
      name; and wrote</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it down to a receipt--that was all."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne's face showed that the light came but slowly
      into her mind.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But that's forgery--is not it?" asked she at length, in
      terror.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"People call it so," said Edward; "I call it borrowing from
      an old friend,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">who was always willing to lend."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Does he know?--is he angry?" asked Mrs. Browne.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes, he knows; and he blusters a deal. He was working
      himself up grandly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at first. Maggie! I was getting rarely frightened, I can
      tell you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Has he been here?" said Mrs. Browne, in bewildered
      fright.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, yes! he and Maggie have been having a long talk, while
      I was hid in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the china-closet. I would not go over that half-hour again
      for any money.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">However, he and Maggie came to terms, at last."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No, Edward, we did not!" said Maggie, in a low quivering
      voice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Very nearly. She's to give up her engagement, and then he
      will let me</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">off."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Do you mean that Maggie is to give up her engagement to
      Mr. Frank Buxton?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">asked his mother.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes. It would never have come to anything, one might see
      that. Old Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would have held out against it till doomsday. And, sooner
      or later, Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would have grown weary. If Maggie had had any spirit, she
      might have worked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him up to marry her before now; and then I should have been
      spared even</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">this fright, for they would never have set the police after
      Mrs. Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's brother."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Why, dearest, Edward, the police are not after you, are
      they?" said Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Browne, for the first time alive to the urgency of the
      case.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I believe they are though," said Edward. "But after what
      Mr. Buxton</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">promised this morning, it does not signify."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He did not promise anything," said Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward turned sharply to her, and looked at her. Then he
      went and took hold</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of her wrists with no gentle grasp, and spoke to her
      through his set teeth.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What do you mean, Maggie?--what do you mean?" (giving her
      a little shake.)</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Do you mean that you'll stick to your lover through thick
      and thin, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">leave your brother to be transported? Speak, can't
      you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She looked up at him, and tried to speak, but no words came
      out of her dry</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">throat. At last she made a strong effort.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You must give me time to think. I will do what is right,
      by God's help."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"As if it was not right--and such can't--to save your
      brother," said he,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">throwing her hands away in a passionate manner.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I must be alone," said Maggie, rising, and trying to stand
      steadily in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">reeling room. She heard her mother and Edward speaking, but
      their words</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gave her no meaning, and she went out. She was leaving the
      house by the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">kitchen-door, when she remembered Nancy, left alone and
      helpless all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">through this long morning; and, ill as she could endure
      detention from the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">solitude she longed to seek, she patiently fulfilled her
      small duties, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sought out some breakfast for the poor old woman.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When she carried it up stairs, Nancy said:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There's something up. You've trouble in your sweet face,
      my darling. Never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mind telling me--only don't sob so. I'll pray for you,
      bairn: and God will</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">help you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Thank you, Nancy. Do!" and she left the room.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER IX.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When she opened the kitchen-door there was the same small,
      mizzling rain</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that had obscured the light for weeks, and now it seemed to
      obscure hope.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She clambered slowly (for indeed she was very feeble) up
      the Fell-Lane,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and threw herself under the leafless thorn, every small
      branch and twig</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of which was loaded with rain-drops. She did not see the
      well-beloved</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and familiar landscape for her tears, and did not miss the
      hills in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">distance that were hidden behind the rain-clouds, and
      sweeping showers.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne and Edward sat over the fire. He told her his
      own story; making</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the temptation strong; the crime a mere trifling, venial
      error, which he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had been led into, through his idea that he was to become
      Mr. Buxton's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">agent.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But if it is only that," said Mrs. Browne, "surely Mr.
      Buxton will not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think of going to law with you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It's not merely going to law that he will think of, but
      trying and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">transporting me. That Henry he has got for his agent is as
      sharp as a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">needle, and as hard as a nether mill-stone. And the fellow
      has obtained</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">such a hold over Mr. Buxton, that he dare but do what he
      tells him. I can't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">imagine how he had so much free-will left as to come with
      his proposal to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie; unless, indeed, Henry knows of it--or, what is most
      likely of all,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has put him up to it. Between them they have given that
      poor fool Crayston</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a pretty dose of it; and I should have come yet worse off
      if it had not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been for Maggie. Let me get clear this time, and I will
      keep to windward of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the law for the future."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If we sold the cottage we could repay it," said Mrs.
      Browne, meditating.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie and I could live on very little. But you see this
      property is held</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in trust for you two."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Nay, mother; you must not talk of repaying it. Depend upon
      it he will be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so glad to have Frank free from his engagement, that he
      won't think of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">asking for the money. And if Mr. Henry says anything about
      it, we can tell</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him it's not half the damages they would have had to have
      given Maggie, if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank had been extricated in any other way. I wish she
      would come back; I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would prime her a little as to what to say. Keep a look
      out, mother, lest</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton returns and find me here."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wish Maggie would come in too," said Mrs. Browne. "I'm
      afraid she'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">catch cold this damp day, and then I shall have two to
      nurse. You think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she'll give it up, don't you, Edward? If she does not I'm
      afraid of harm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coming to you. Had you not better keep out of the way?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It's fine talking. Where am I to go out of sight of the
      police this wet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">day: without a shilling in the world too? If you'll give me
      some money I'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be off fast enough, and make assurance doubly sure. I'm not
      much afraid of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie. She's a little yea-nay thing, and I can always bend
      her round to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what we want. She had better take care, too," said he, with
      a desperate</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">look on his face, "for by G---- I'll make her give up all
      thoughts of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank, rather than be taken and tried. Why! it's my chance
      for all my life;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and do you think I'll have it frustrated for a girl's
      whim?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I think it's rather hard upon her too," pleaded his
      mother. "She's very</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fond of him; and it would have been such a good match for
      her."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Pooh! she's not nineteen yet, and has plenty of time
      before her to pick</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up somebody else; while, don't you see, if I'm caught and
      transported, I'm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">done for life. Besides I've a notion Frank had already
      begun to be tired of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the affair; it would have been broken off in a month or
      two, without her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gaining anything by it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well, if you think so," replied Mrs. Browne. "But I'm
      sorry for her. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">always told her she was foolish to think so much about him:
      but I know</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she'll fret a deal if it's given up."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh! she'll soon comfort herself with thinking that she has
      saved me. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wish she'd come. It must be near eleven. I do wish she
      would come. Hark! is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not that the kitchen-door?" said he, turning white, and
      betaking himself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">once more to the china-closet. He held it ajar till he
      heard Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">stepping softly and slowly across the floor. She opened the
      parlor-door;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and stood looking in, with the strange imperceptive gaze of
      a sleep-walker.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Then she roused herself and saw that he was not there; so
      she came in a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">step or two, and sat down in her dripping cloak on a chair
      near the door.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward returned, bold now there was no danger.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie!" said he, "what have you fixed to say to Mr.
      Burton?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She sighed deeply; and then lifted up her large innocent
      eyes to his face.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I cannot give up Frank," said she, in a low, quiet
      voice.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne threw up her hands and exclaimed in terror:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh Edward, Edward! go away--I will give you all the plate
      I have; you can</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sell it--my darling, go!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Not till I have brought Maggie to reason," said he, in a
      manner as quiet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as her own, but with a subdued ferocity in it, which she
      saw, but which did</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not intimidate her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He went up to her, and spoke below his breath.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, we were children together--we two--brother and
      sister of one</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">blood! Do you give me up to be put in prison--in the
      hulks--among the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">basest of criminals--I don't know where--all for the sake
      of your own</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">selfish happiness?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She trembled very much; but did not speak or cry, or make
      any noise.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You were always selfish. You always thought of yourself.
      But this time</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I did think you would have shown how different you could
      be. But it's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">self--self--paramount above all."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh Maggie! how can you be so hard-hearted and selfish?"
      echoed Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Browne, crying and sobbing.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mother!" said Maggie, "I know that I think too often and
      too much of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">myself. But this time I thought only of Frank. He loves me;
      it would break</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his heart if I wrote as Mr. Buxton wishes, cutting our
      lives asunder, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">giving no reason for it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He loves you so!" said Edward, tauntingly. "A man's love
      break his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heart! You've got some pretty notions! Who told you that he
      loved you so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">desperately? How do you know it?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Because I love him so," said she, in a quiet, earnest
      voice. "I do not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">know of any other reason; but that is quite sufficient to
      me. I believe</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him when he says he loves me; and I have no right to cause
      him the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">infinite--the terrible pain, which my own heart tells me he
      would feel, if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I did what Mr. Buxton wishes me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Her manner was so simple and utterly truthful, that it was
      as quiet and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fearless as a child's; her brother's fierce looks of anger
      had no power</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">over her; and his blustering died away before her into
      something of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">frightened cowardliness he had shown in the morning. But
      Mrs. Browne came</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up to Maggie; and took her hand between both of hers, which
      were trembling.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, you can save Edward. I know I have not loved you
      as I should have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">done; but I will love and comfort you forever, if you will
      but write as Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton says. Think! Perhaps Mr. Frank may not take you at
      your word, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">may come over and see you, and all may be right, and yet
      Edward may be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">saved. It is only writing this letter; you need not stick
      to it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No!" said Edward. "A signature, if you can prove
      compulsion, is not valid.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">We will all prove that you write this letter under
      compulsion; and if Frank</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">loves you so desperately, he won't give you up without a
      trial to make you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">change your mind."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No!" said Maggie, firmly. "If I write the letter I abide
      by it. I will not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quibble with my conscience. Edward! I will not marry--I
      will go and live</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">near you, and come to you whenever I may--and give up my
      life to you if you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">are sent to prison; my mother and I will go, if need be--I
      do not know yet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what I can do, or cannot do, for you, but all I can I will;
      but this one</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thing I cannot."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Then I'm off!" said Edward. "On your deathbed may you
      remember this hour,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and how you denied your only brother's request. May you ask
      my forgiveness</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with your dying breath, and may I be there to deny it
      you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Wait a minute!" said Maggie, springing up, rapidly.
      "Edward, don't curse</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me with such terrible words till all is done. Mother, I
      implore you to keep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him here. Hide him--do what you can to conceal him. I will
      have one more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">trial." She snatched up her bonnet, and was gone, before
      they had time to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think or speak to arrest her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">On she flew along the Combehurst road. As she went, the
      tears fell like</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rain down her face, and she talked to herself.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He should not have said so. No! he should not have said
      so. We were the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">only two." But still she pressed on, over the thick, wet,
      brown heather.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She saw Mr. Buxton coming; and she went still quicker. The
      rain had cleared</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">off, and a yellow watery gleam of sunshine was struggling
      out. She stopped</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or he would have passed her unheeded; little expecting to
      meet her there.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wanted to see you," said she, all at once resuming her
      composure, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">almost assuming a dignified manner. "You must not go down
      to our house; we</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have sorrow enough there. Come under these fir-trees, and
      let me speak to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I hope you have thought of what I said, and are willing to
      do what I asked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No!" said she. "I have thought and thought. I did not
      think in a selfish</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spirit, though they say I did. I prayed first. I could not
      do that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">earnestly, and be selfish, I think. I cannot give up Frank.
      I know the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">disgrace; and if he, knowing all, thinks fit to give me up,
      I shall never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">say a word, but bow my head, and try and live out my
      appointed days quietly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and cheerfully. But he is the judge, not you; nor have I
      any right to do</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what you ask me." She stopped, because the agitation took
      away her breath.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He began in a cold manner:--"I am very sorry. The law must
      take its course.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I would have saved my son from the pain of all this
      knowledge, and that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which he will of course feel in the necessity of giving up
      his engagement.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I would have refused to appear against your brother,
      shamefully ungrateful</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">as he has been. Now you cannot wonder that I act according
      to my agent's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">advice, and prosecute your brother as if he were a
      stranger."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He turned to go away. He was so cold and determined that
      for a moment</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was timid. But she then laid her hand on his
      arm.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mr. Buxton," said she, "you will not do what you threaten.
      I know you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">better. Think! My father was your old friend. That claim
      is, perhaps, done</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">away with by Edward's conduct. But I do not believe you can
      forget it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">always. If you did fulfill the menace you uttered just now,
      there would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">come times as you grew older, and life grew fainter and
      fainter before</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you--quiet times of thought, when you remembered the days
      of your youth,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and the friends you then had and knew;--you would recollect
      that one of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">them had left an only son, who had done wrong--who had
      sinned--sinned</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">against you in his weakness--and you would think then--you
      could not help</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it--how you had forgotten mercy in justice--and, as justice
      required he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">should be treated as a felon, you threw him among
      felons--where every</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glimmering of goodness was darkened for ever. Edward is,
      after all, more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">weak than wicked;--but he will become wicked if you put him
      in prison,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and have him transported. God is merciful--we cannot tell
      or think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">how merciful. Oh, sir, I am so sure you will be merciful,
      and give my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">brother--my poor sinning brother--a chance, that I will
      tell you all. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will throw myself upon your pity. Edward is even now at
      home--miserable</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and desperate;--my mother is too much stunned to understand
      all our</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wretchedness--for very wretched we are in our shame."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">As she spoke the wind arose and shivered in the wiry leaves
      of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fir-trees, and there was a moaning sound as of some Ariel
      imprisoned in the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thick branches that, tangled overhead, made a shelter for
      them. Either the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">noise or Mr. Buxton's fancy called up an echo to Maggie's
      voice--a pleading</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with her pleading--a sad tone of regret, distinct yet
      blending with her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">speech, and a falling, dying sound, as her voice died away
      in miserable</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suspense.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It might be that, formed as she was by Mrs. Buxton's care
      and love, her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accents and words were such as that lady, now at rest from
      all sorrow,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would have used;--somehow, at any rate, the thought flashed
      into Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's mind, that as Maggie spoke, his dead wife's voice
      was heard,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">imploring mercy in a clear, distinct tone, though faint, as
      if separated</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from him by an infinite distance of space. At least, this
      is the account</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton would have given of the manner in which the idea
      of his wife</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">became present to him, and what she would have wished him
      to do a powerful</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">motive in his conduct. Words of hers, long ago spoken, and
      merciful,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">forgiving expressions made use of in former days to soften
      him in some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">angry mood, were clearly remembered while Maggie spoke; and
      their influence</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was perceptible in the change of his tone, and the wavering
      of his manner</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">henceforward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And yet you will not save Frank from being involved in
      your disgrace,"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">said he; but more as if weighing and deliberating on the
      case than he had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ever spoken before.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If Frank wishes it, I will quietly withdraw myself out of
      his sight</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">forever;--I give you my promise, before God, to do so. I
      shall not utter</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one word of entreaty or complaint. I will try not to wonder
      or feel</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">surprise;--I will bless him in every action of his future
      life--but think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">how different would be the disgrace he would voluntarily
      incur to my poor</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother's shame, when she wakens up to know what her child
      has done! Her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very torper about it now is more painful than words can
      tell."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What could Edward do?" asked Mr. Buxton. "Mr. Henry won't
      hear of my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">passing over any frauds."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, you relent!" said Maggie, taking his hand, and
      pressing it. "What</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">could he do? He could do the same, whatever it was, as you
      thought of his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">doing, if I had written that terrible letter."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And you'll be willing to give it up, if Frank wishes, when
      he knows all?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">asked Mr. Buxton.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She crossed her hands and drooped her head, but answered
      steadily.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Whatever Frank wishes, when he knows all, I will gladly
      do. I will speak</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the truth. I do not believe that any shame surrounding me,
      and not in me,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will alter Frank's love one title."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"We shall see," said Mr. Buxton. "But what I thought of
      Edward's doing, in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">case--Well never mind! (seeing how she shrunk back from all
      mention of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">letter he had asked her to write,)--was to go to America,
      out of the way.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Then Mr. Henry would think he had escaped, and need never
      be told of my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">coenivance. I think he would throw up the agency, if he
      were; and he's a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very clever man. If Ned is in England, Mr. Henry will
      ferret him out. And,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">besides, this affair is so blown, I don't think he could
      return to his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">profession. What do you say to this, Maggie?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I will tell my mother. I must ask her. To me it seems most
      desirable.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Only, I fear he is very ill; and it seems lonely; but never
      mind! We ought</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to be thankful to you forever. I cannot tell you how I hope
      and trust he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will live to show you what your goodness has made him."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But you must lose no time. If Mr. Henry traces him; I
      can't answer for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">myself. I shall have no good reason to give, as I should
      have had, if I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">could have told him that Frank and you were to be as
      strangers to each</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">other. And even then I should have been afraid, he is such
      a determined</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fellow; but uncommonly clever. Stay!" said he, yielding to
      a sudden and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">inexplicable desire to see Edward, and discover if his
      criminality had in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">any way changed his outward appearance. "I'll go with you.
      I can hasten</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">things. If Edward goes, he must be off, as soon as
      possible, to Liverpool,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and leave no trace. The next packet sails the day after
      to-morrow. I noted</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it down from the <i>Times</i>."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie and he sped along the road. He spoke his thoughts
      aloud:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I wonder if he will be grateful to me for this. Not that I
      ever mean to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">look for gratitude again. I mean to try, not to care for
      anybody but Frank.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">'Govern men by outward force,' says Mr. Henry. He is an
      uncommonly clever</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">man, and he says, the longer he lives, the more he is
      convinced of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">badness of men. He always looks for it now, even in those
      who are the best,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">apparently."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was too anxious to answer, or even to attend to him.
      At the top of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the slope she asked him to wait while she ran down and told
      the result of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her conversation with him. Her mother was alone, looking
      white and sick.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She told her that Edward had gone into the hay-loft, above
      the old, disused</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shippon.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie related the substance of her interview with Mr.
      Buxton, and his wish</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that Edward should go to America.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"To America!" said Mrs. Browne. "Why that's as far as
      Botany Bay. It's just</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">like transporting him. I thought you'd done something for
      us, you looked so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glad."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dearest mother, it <i>is</i> something. He is
      not to be subjected to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">imprisonment or trial. I must go and tell him, only I must
      beckon to Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton first. But when he comes, do show him how thankful
      we are for his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mercy to Edward."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne's murmurings, whatever was their meaning, were
      lost upon</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie. She ran through the court, and up the slope, with
      the lightness of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a lawn; for though she was tired in body to an excess she
      had never been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">before in her life, the opening beam of hope in the dark
      sky made her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spirit conquer her flesh for the time.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She did not stop to speak, but turned again as soon as she
      had signed to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton to follow her. She left the house-door open for
      his entrance,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and passed out again through the kitchen into the space
      behind, which was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">partly an uninclosed yard, and partly rocky common. She ran
      across the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little green to the shippon, and mounted the ladder into
      the dimly-lighted</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">loft. Up in a dark corner Edward stood, with an old rake in
      his hand.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I thought it was you, Maggie!" said he, heaving a deep
      breath of relief.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"What have you done? Have you agreed to write the letter?
      You've done</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">something for me, I see by your looks."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes! I have told Mr. Buxton all. He is waiting for you in
      the parlor. Oh!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I knew he could not be so hard!" She was out of breath.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't understand you!" said he. "You've never been such
      a fool as to go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and tell him where I am?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes, I have. I felt I might trust him. He has promised not
      to prosecute</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you. The worst is, he says you must go to America. But come
      down, Ned, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">speak to him. You owe him thanks, and he wants to see
      you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I can't go through a scene. I'm not up to it. Besides, are
      you sure he is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not entrapping me to the police? If I had a farthing of
      money I would not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">trust him, but be off to the moors."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, Edward! How do you think he would do anything so
      treacherous and mean?</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I beg you not to lose time in distrust. He says himself, if
      Mr. Henry comes</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">before you are off, he does not know what will be the
      consequence. The</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">packet sails for America in two days. It is sad for you to
      have to go.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Perhaps even yet he may think of something better, though I
      don't know how</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">we can ask or expect it."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I don't want anything better," replied he, "than that I
      should have money</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">enough to carry me to America. I'm in more scrapes than
      this (though none</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so bad) in England; and in America there's many an opening
      to fortune." He</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">followed her down the steps while he spoke. Once in the
      yellow light of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">watery day, she was struck by his ghastly look. Sharp lines
      of suspicion</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and cunning seemed to have been stamped upon his face,
      making it look</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">older by many years than his age warranted. His jaunty
      evening dress,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all weather-stained and dirty, added to his forlorn and
      disreputable</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">appearance; but most of all--deepest of all--was the
      impression she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">received that he was not long for this world; and oh! how
      unfit for the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">next! Still, if time was given--if he were placed far away
      from temptation,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she thought that her father's son might yet repent, and be
      saved. She took</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his hand, for he was hanging back as they came near the
      parlor-door, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">led him in. She looked like some guardian angel, with her
      face that beamed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">out trust, and hope, and thankfulness. He, on the contrary,
      hung his head</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in angry, awkward shame; and half wished he had trusted to
      his own wits,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and tried to evade the police, rather than have been forced
      into this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">interview.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">His mother came to him; for she loved him all the more
      fondly, now he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seemed degraded and friendless. She could not, or would
      not, comprehend the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">extent of his guilt; and had upbraided Mr. Buxton to the
      top of her bent</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for thinking of sending him away to America. There was a
      silence when he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">came in which was insupportable to him. He looked up with
      clouded eyes,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that dared not meet Mr. Buxton's.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am here, sir, to learn what you wish me to do. Maggie
      says I am to go to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">America; if that is where you want to send me, I'm
      ready."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton wished himself away as heartily as Edward. Mrs.
      Browne's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">upbraidings, just when he felt that he had done a kind
      action, and yielded,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">against his judgment, to Maggie's entreaties, had made him
      think himself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very ill used. And now here was Edward speaking in a
      sullen, savage kind</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of way, instead of showing any gratitude. The idea of Mr.
      Henry's stern</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">displeasure loomed in the background.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes!" said he, "I'm glad to find you come into the idea of
      going to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">America. It's the only place for you. The sooner you can
      go, and the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">better."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I can't go without money," said Edward, doggedly. "If I
      had had money, I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">need not have come here."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, Ned! would you have gone without seeing me?" said Mrs.
      Browne,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bursting into tears. "Mr. Buxton, I cannot let him go to
      America. Look how</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ill he is. He'll die if you send him there."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mother, don't give way so," said Edward, kindly, taking
      her hand. "I'm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not ill, at least not to signify. Mr. Buxton is right:
      America is the only</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">place for me. To tell the truth, even if Mr. Buxton is good
      enough" (he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">said this as if unwilling to express any word of
      thankfulness) "not to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">prosecute me, there are others who may--and will. I'm safer
      out of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">country. Give me money enough to get to Liverpool and pay
      my passage, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I'll be off this minute."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You shall not," said Mrs. Browne, holding him tightly.
      "You told me this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">morning you were led into temptation, and went wrong
      because you had no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">comfortable home, nor any one to care for you, and make you
      happy. It will</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">be worse in America. You'll get wrong again, and be away
      from all who can</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">help you. Or you'll die all by yourself, in some backwood
      or other. Maggie!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you might speak and help me--how can you stand so still,
      and let him go to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">America without a word!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie looked up bright and steadfast, as if she saw
      something beyond the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">material present. Here was the opportunity for
      self-sacrifice of which Mrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton had spoken to her in her childish days--the time
      which comes to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all, but comes unheeded and unseen to those whose eyes are
      not trained to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">watching.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Mother! could you do without me for a time? If you could,
      and it would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">make you easier, and help Edward to"--The word on her lips
      died away; for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it seemed to imply a reproach on one who stood in his shame
      among them all.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You would go!" said Mrs. Browne, catching at the
      unfinished sentence. "Oh!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie, that's the best thing you've ever said or done
      since you were born.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward, would not you like to have Maggie with you?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes," said he, "well enough. It would be far better for me
      than going all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">alone; though I dare say I could make my way pretty well
      after a time. If</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she went, she might stay till I felt settled, and had made
      some friends,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and then she could come back."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton was astonished at first by this proposal of
      Maggie's. He could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not all at once understand the difference between what she
      now offered to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">do, and what he had urged upon her only this very morning.
      But as he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought about it, he perceived that what was her own she
      was willing to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sacrifice; but that Frank's heart, once given into her
      faithful keeping,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she was answerable for it to him and to God. This light
      came down upon him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">slowly; but when he understood, he admired with almost a
      wondering</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">admiration. That little timid girl brave enough to cross
      the ocean and go</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to a foreign land, if she could only help to save her
      brother!</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'm sure Maggie," said he, turning towards her, "you are a
      good,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thoughtful little creature. It may be the saving of
      Edward--I believe it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will. I think God will bless you for being so devoted."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"The expense will be doubled," said Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My dear boy! never mind the money. I can get it advanced
      upon this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">cottage."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"As for that, I'll advance it," said Mr. Buxton.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Could we not," said Maggie, hesitating from her want of
      knowledge, "make</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">over the furniture--papa's books, and what little plate we
      have, to Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton--something like pawning them--if he would advance
      the requisite</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">money? He, strange as it may seem, is the only person you
      can ask in this</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">great strait."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And so it was arranged, after some demur on Mr. Buxton's
      part. But Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">kept steadily to her point as soon as she found that it was
      attainable; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne was equally inflexible, though from a different
      feeling. She</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">regarded Mr. Buxton as the cause of her son's banishment,
      and refused to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">accept of any favor from him. If there had been time,
      indeed, she would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">have preferred obtaining the money in the same manner from
      any one else.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward brightened up a little when he heard the sum could
      be procured; he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was almost indifferent how; and, strangely callous, as
      Maggie thought,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he even proposed to draw up a legal form of assignment. Mr.
      Buxton only</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought of hurrying on the departure; but he could not
      refrain from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">expressing his approval and admiration of Maggie whenever
      he came near her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Before he went, he called her aside.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My dear, I'm not sure if Frank can do better than marry
      you, after all.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mind! I've not given it as much thought as I should like.
      But if you come</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">back as we plan, next autumn, and he is steady to you till
      then--and Edward</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is going on well--(if he can but keep good, he'll do, for
      he is very</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sharp--yon is a knowing paper he drew up)--why, I'll think
      about it. Only</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">let Frank see a bit of the world first. I'd rather you did
      not tell him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I've any thoughts of coming round, that he may have a fair
      trial; and I'll</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">keep it from Erminia if I can, or she will let it all out
      to him. I shall</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">see you to-morrow at the coach. God bless you, my girl, and
      keep you on the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">great wide sea." He was absolutely in tears when he went
      away--tears of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">admiring regret over Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER X.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The more Maggie thought, the more she felt sure that the
      impulse on which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she had acted in proposing to go with her brother was
      right. She feared</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">there was little hope for his character, whatever there
      might be for his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">worldly fortune, if he were thrown, in the condition of
      mind in which he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was now, among the set of adventurous men who are
      continually going over to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">America in search of an El Dorado to be discovered by their
      wits. She knew</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she had but little influence over him at present; but she
      would not doubt</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or waver in her hope that patience and love might work him
      right at last.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She meant to get some employment--in teaching--in
      needlework--in a shop--no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">matter how humble--and be no burden to him, and make him a
      happy home, from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which he should feel no wish to wander. Her chief anxiety
      was about her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother. She did not dwell more than she could help on her
      long absence from</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank; it was too sad, and yet too necessary. She meant to
      write and tell</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him all about herself and Edward. The only thing which she
      would keep for</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some happy future should be the possible revelation of the
      proposal which</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mr. Buxton had made, that she should give up her engagement
      as a condition</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of his not prosecuting Edward.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">There was much sorrowful bustle in the moorland cottage
      that day. Erminia</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">brought up a portion of the money Mr. Buxton was to
      advance, with an</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">entreaty that Edward would not show himself out of his
      home; and an account</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of a letter from Mr. Henry, stating that the Woodchester
      police believed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him to be in London, and that search was being made for him
      there.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia looked very grave and pale. She gave her message to
      Mrs. Browne,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">speaking little beyond what was absolutely necessary. Then
      she took Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">aside, and suddenly burst into tears.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, darling--what is this going to America? You've
      always and always</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been sacrificing yourself to your family, and now you're
      setting off,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nobody knows where, in some vain hope of reforming Edward.
      I wish he was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not your brother, that I might speak of him as I should
      like."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He has been doing what is very wrong," said Maggie. "But
      you--none of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you--know his good points--nor how he has been exposed to
      all sorts of bad</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">influences, I am sure; and never had the advantage of a
      father's training</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and friendship, which are so inestimable to a son. O,
      Minnie! when I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remember how we two used to kneel down in the evenings at
      my father's knee,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and say our prayers; and then listen in awe-struck silence
      to his earnest</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">blessing, which grew more like a prayer for us as his life
      waned away,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I would do anything for Edward rather than that wrestling
      agony of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">supplication should have been in vain. I think of him as
      the little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">innocent boy, whose arm was round me as if to support me in
      the Awful</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Presence, whose true name of Love we had not learned.
      Minnie! he has had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">no proper training--no training, I mean, to enable him to
      resist</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">temptation--and he has been thrown into it without warning
      or advice. Now</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he knows what it is; and I must try, though I am but an
      unknowing girl, to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">warn and to strengthen him. Don't weaken my faith. Who can
      do right if we</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lose faith in them?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And Frank!" said Erminia, after a pause. "Poor Frank!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Dear Frank!" replied Maggie, looking up, and trying to
      smile; but, in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spite of herself, her eyes filled with tears. "If I could
      have asked him,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I know he would approve of what I am going to do. He would
      feel it to be</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">right that I should make every effort--I don't mean," said
      she, as the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tears would fall down her cheeks in spite of her quivering
      effort at a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">smile, "that I should not have liked to have seen him. But
      it is no use</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">talking of what one would have liked. I am writing a long
      letter to him at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">every pause of leisure."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"And I'm keeping you all this time," said Erminia, getting
      up, yet loth to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">go. "When do you intend to come back? Let us feel there is
      a fixed time.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">America! Why, it's thousands of miles away. Oh, Maggie!
      Maggie!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I shall come back the next autumn, I trust," said Maggie,
      comforting her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">friend with many a soft caress. "Edward will be settled
      then, I hope. You</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were longer in France, Minnie. Frank was longer away that
      time he wintered</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in Italy with Mr. Monro."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia went slowly to the door. Then she turned, right
      facing Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie! tell the truth. Has my uncle been urging you to
      go? Because if he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">has, don't trust him; it is only to break off your
      engagement."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No, he has not, indeed. It was my own thought at first.
      Then in a moment I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">saw the relief it was to my mother--my poor mother!
      Erminia, the thought</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of her grief at Edward's absence is the trial; for my sake,
      you will come</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">often and often, and comfort her in every way you can."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes! that I will; tell me everything I can do for you."
      Kissing each</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">other, with long lingering delay they parted.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy would be informed of the cause of the commotion in
      the house; and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when she had in some degree ascertained its nature, she
      wasted no time</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in asking further questions, but quietly got up and dressed
      herself;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and appeared among them, weak and trembling, indeed, but so
      calm and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thoughtful, that her presence was an infinite help to
      Maggie.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">When day closed in, Edward stole down to the house once
      more. He was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">haggard enough to have been in anxiety and concealment for
      a month. But</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when his body was refreshed, his spirits rose in a way
      inconceivable to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie. The Spaniards who went out with Pizarro were not
      lured on by more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fantastic notions of the wealth to be acquired in the New
      World than he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was. He dwelt on these visions in so brisk and vivid a
      manner, that he even</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">made his mother cease her weary weeping (which had lasted
      the livelong day,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">despite all Maggie's efforts) to look up and listen to
      him.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'll answer for it," said he: "before long I'll be an
      American judge with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">miles of cotton plantations."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"But in America," sighed out his mother.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Never mind, mother!" said he, with a tenderness which made
      Maggie's heart</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glad. "If you won't come over to America to me, why, I'll
      sell them all,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and come back to live in England. People will forget the
      scrapes that the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rich American got into in his youth."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You can pay back Mr. Buxton then," said his mother.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, yes--of course," replied he, as if falling into a new
      and trivial</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">idea.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Thus the evening whiled away. The mother and son sat, hand
      in hand, before</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the little glinting blazing parlor fire, with the unlighted
      candles on the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">table behind. Maggie, busy in preparations, passed softly
      in and out. And</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when all was done that could be done before going to
      Liverpool, where she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hoped to have two days to prepare their outfit more
      completely, she stole</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">back to her mother's side. But her thoughts would wander
      off to Frank,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"working his way south through all the hunting-counties,"
      as he had written</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her word. If she had not urged his absence, he would have
      been here for her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to see his noble face once more; but then, perhaps, she
      might never have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">had the strength to go.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Late, late in the night they separated. Maggie could not
      rest, and stole</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">into her mother's room. Mrs. Browne had cried herself to
      sleep, like a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">child. Maggie stood and looked at her face, and then knelt
      down by the bed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and prayed. When she arose, she saw that her mother was
      awake, and had been</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looking at her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie dear! you're a good girl, and I think God will hear
      your prayer</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">whatever it was for. I cannot tell you what a relief it is
      to me to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">think you're going with him. It would have broken my heart
      else. If I've</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sometimes not been as kind as I might have been, I ask your
      forgiveness,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">now, my dear; and I bless you and thank you for going out
      with him; for I'm</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sure he's not well and strong, and will need somebody to
      take care of him.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And you shan't lose with Mr. Frank, for as sure as I see
      him I'll tell him</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what a good daughter and sister you've been; and I shall
      say, for all he is</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">so rich, I think he may look long before he finds a wife
      for him like our</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie. I do wish Ned had got that new greatcoat, he says
      he left behind</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">him at Woodchester." Her mind reverted to her darling son;
      but Maggie took</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her short slumber by her mother's side, with her mother's
      arms around her;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and awoke and felt that her sleep had been blessed. At the
      coach-office</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the next morning they met Mr. Buxton all ready as if for a
      journey, but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glancing about him as if in fear of some coming enemy.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I'm going with you to Liverpool," said he. "Don't make any
      ado about it,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">please. I shall like to see you off; and I may be of some
      use to you, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia begged it of me; and, besides, it will keep me out
      of Mr. Henry's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">way for a little time, and I'm afraid he will find it all
      out, and think me</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">very weak; but you see he made me too hard upon Crayston,
      so I may take it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">out in a little soft-heartedness toward the son of an old
      friend."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Just at this moment Erminia came running through the white
      morning mist all</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">glowing with haste.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie," said she, "I'm come to take care of your mother.
      My uncle says</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">she and Nancy must come to us for a long, long visit. Or if
      she would</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rather go home, I'll go with her till she feels able to
      come to us, and do</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">anything I can think of for her. I will try to be a
      daughter till you come</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">back, Maggie; only don't be long, or Frank and I shall
      break our hearts."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie waited till her mother had ended her long clasping
      embrace of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward, who was subdued enough this morning; and then, with
      something like</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Esau's craving for a blessing, she came to bid her mother
      good-bye, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">received the warm caress she had longed for for years. In
      another moment</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the coach was away; and before half an hour had elapsed,
      Combehurst</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">church-spire had been lost in a turn of the road.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward and Mr. Buxton did not speak to each other, and
      Maggie was nearly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">silent. They reached Liverpool in the afternoon; and Mr.
      Buxton, who had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">been there once or twice before, took them directly to some
      quiet hotel. He</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was far more anxious that Edward should not expose himself
      to any chance of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">recognition than Edward himself. He went down to the Docks
      to secure berths</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in the vessel about to sail the next day, and on his return
      he took Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">out to make the requisite purchases.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Did you pay for us, sir?" said Maggie, anxious to
      ascertain the amount of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">money she had left, after defraying the passage.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Yes," replied he, rather confused. "Erminia begged me not
      to tell you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">about it, but I can't manage a secret well. You see she did
      not like the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">idea of your going as steerage-passengers as you meant to
      do; and she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">desired me to take you cabin places for her. It is no doing
      of mine, my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dear. I did not think of it; but now I have seen how
      crowded the steerage</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">is, I am very glad Erminia had so much thought. Edward
      might have roughed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it well enough there, but it would never have done for
      you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It was very kind of Erminia," said Maggie, touched at this
      consideration</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of her friend; "but..."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Now don't 'but' about it," interrupted he. "Erminia is
      very rich, and has</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">more money than she knows what to do with. I'm only vexed I
      did not think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of if myself. For Maggie, though I may have my own ways of
      thinking on some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">points, I can't be blind to your goodness."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">All evening Mr. Buxton was busy, and busy on their behalf.
      Even Edward,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when he saw the attention that was being paid to his
      physical comfort,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">felt a kind of penitence; and after choking once or twice
      in the attempt,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">conquered his pride (such I call it for want of a better
      word) so far as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to express some regret for his past conduct, and some
      gratitude for Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton's present kindness. He did it awkwardly enough, but
      it pleased Mr.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Buxton.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well--well--that's all very right," said he, reddening
      from his own</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">uncomfortableness of feeling. "Now don't say any more about
      it, but do your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">best in America; don't let me feel I've been a fool in
      letting you off. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">know Mr. Henry will think me so. And, above all, take care
      of Maggie. Mind</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">what she says, and you're sure to go right."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He asked them to go on board early the next day, as he had
      promised Erminia</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to see them there, and yet wished to return as soon as he
      could. It was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">evident that he hoped, by making his absence as short as
      possible, to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">prevent Mr. Henry's ever knowing that he had left home, or
      in any way</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">connived at Edward's escape.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">So, although the vessel was not to sail till the
      afternoon's tide, they</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">left the hotel soon after breakfast, and went to the
      "Anna-Maria." They</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were among the first passengers on board. Mr. Buxton took
      Maggie down to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her cabin. She then saw the reason of his business the
      evening before.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Every store that could be provided was there. A number of
      books lay on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the little table--books just suited to Maggie's taste.
      "There!" said he,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rubbing his hands. "Don't thank me. It's all Erminia's
      doing. She gave me</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the list of books. I've not got all; but I think they'll be
      enough. Just</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">write me one line, Maggie, to say I've done my best."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie wrote with tears in her eyes--tears of love toward
      the generous</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Erminia. A few minutes more and Mr. Buxton was gone. Maggie
      watched him as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">long as she could see him; and as his portly figure
      disappeared among the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">crowd on the pier, her heart sank within her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Edward's, on the contrary, rose at his absence. The only
      one, cognisant of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his shame and ill-doing, was gone. A new life lay before
      him, the opening</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of which was made agreeable to him, by the position in
      which he found</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">himself placed, as a cabin-passenger; with many comforts
      provided for him;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">for although Maggie's wants had been the principal object
      of Mr. Buxton's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">attention, Edward was not forgotten.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He was soon among the sailors, talking away in a rather
      consequential</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">manner. He grew acquainted with the remainder of the
      cabin-passengers, at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">least those who arrived before the final bustle began; and
      kept bringing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his sister such little pieces of news as he could
      collect.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, they say we are likely to have a good start, and a
      fine moonlight</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">night." Away again he went.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I say, Maggie, that's an uncommonly pretty girl come on
      board, with those</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">old people in black. Gone down into the cabin, now; I wish
      you would scrape</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">up an acquaintance with her, and give me a chance."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">CHAPTER XI.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie sat on deck, wrapped in her duffel-cloak; the old
      familiar cloak,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">which had been her wrap in many a happy walk in the haunts
      near her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">moorland home. The weather was not cold for the time of
      year, but still it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">was chilly to any one that was stationary. But she wanted
      to look her last</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on the shoals of English people, who crowded backward and
      forward, like</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">ants, on the pier. Happy people! who might stay among their
      loved ones. The</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mocking demons gathered round her, as they gather round all
      who sacrifice</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">self, tempting. A crowd of suggestive doubts pressed upon
      her. "Was it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">really necessary that she should go with Edward? Could she
      do him any real</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">good? Would he be in any way influenced by her?" Then the
      demon tried</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">another description of doubt. "Had it ever been her duty to
      go? She was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">leaving her mother alone. She was giving Frank much present
      sorrow. It was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not even yet too late!" She could not endure longer; and
      replied to her own</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tempting heart.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I was right to hope for Edward; I am right to give him the
      chance of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">steadiness which my presence will give. I am doing what my
      mother earnestly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wished me to do; and what to the last she felt relieved by
      my doing. I know</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank will feel sorrow, because I myself have such an
      aching heart; but if</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I had asked him whether I was not right in going, he would
      have been too</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">truthful not to have said yes. I have tried to do right,
      and though I may</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fail, and evil may seem to arise rather than good out of my
      endeavor, yet</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">still I will submit to my failure, and try and say 'God's
      will be done!' If</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">only I might have seen Frank once more, and told him all
      face to face!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">To do away with such thoughts, she determined no longer to
      sit gazing, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tempted by the shore; and, giving one look to the land
      which contained her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lover, she went down below, and busied herself, even
      through her blinding</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">tears, in trying to arrange her own cabin, and Edward's.
      She heard boat</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">after boat arrive loaded with passengers. She learnt from
      Edward, who came</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">down to tell her the fact, that there were upwards of two
      hundred steerage</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">passengers. She felt the tremulous shake which announced
      that the ship was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">loosed from her moorings, and being tugged down the river.
      She wrapped</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">herself up once more, and came on deck, and sat down among
      the many who</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were looking their last look at England. The early winter
      evening was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">darkening in, and shutting out the Welsh coast, the hills
      of which were</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">like the hills of home. She was thankful when she became
      too ill to think</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and remember.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Exhausted and still, she did not know whether she was
      sleeping or waking;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">or whether she had slept since she had thrown herself down
      on her cot, when</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">suddenly, there was a great rush, and then Edward stood
      like lightning by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her, pulling her up by the arm.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"The ship is on fire--to the deck, Maggie! Fire! Fire!" he
      shouted, like</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a maniac, while he dragged her up the stairs--as if the cry
      of Fire could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">summon human aid on the great deep. And the cry was echoed
      up to heaven by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all that crowd in an accent of despair.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">They stood huddled together, dressed and undressed; now in
      red lurid light,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">showing ghastly faces of terror--now in white wreaths of
      smoke--as far away</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">from the steerage as they could press; for there, up from
      the hold,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">rose columns of smoke, and now and then a fierce blaze
      leaped out,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">exulting--higher and higher every time; while from each
      crevice on that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">part of the deck issued harbingers of the terrible
      destruction that awaited</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">them.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The sailors were lowering the boats; and above them stood
      the captain, as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">calm as if he were on his own hearth at home--his home
      where he never more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">should be. His voice was low--was lower; but as clear as a
      bell in its</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">distinctness; as wise in its directions as collected
      thought could make</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it. Some of the steerage passengers were helping; but more
      were dumb and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">motionless with affright. In that dead silence was heard a
      low wail of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">sorrow, as of numbers whose power was crushed out of them
      by that awful</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">terror. Edward still held his clutch of Margaret's arm.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Be ready!" said he, in a fierce whisper.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The fire sprung up along the main-mast, and did not sink or
      disappear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">again. They knew then that all the mad efforts made by some
      few below to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">extinguish it were in vain; and then went up the prayers of
      hundreds, in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mortal agony of fear:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Lord! have mercy upon us!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Not in quiet calm of village church did ever such a pitiful
      cry go up to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heaven; it was like one voice--like the day of judgment in
      the presence of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the Lord.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And after that there was no more silence; but a confusion
      of terrible</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">farewells, and wild cries of affright, and purposeless
      rushes hither and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thither.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The boats were down, rocking on the sea. The captain
      spoke:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Put the children in first; they are the most
      helpless."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">One or two stout sailors stood in the boats to receive
      them. Edward drew</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nearer and nearer to the gangway, pulling Maggie with him.
      She was almost</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pressed to death, and stifled. Close in her ear, she heard
      a woman praying</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to herself. She, poor creature, knew of no presence but
      God's in that awful</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hour, and spoke in a low voice to Him.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My heart's darlings are taken away from me. Faith! faith!
      Oh, my great</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">God! I will die in peace, if Thou wilt but grant me faith
      in this terrible</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hour, to feel that Thou wilt take care of my poor orphans.
      Hush! dearest</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Billy," she cried out shrill to a little fellow in the boat
      waiting for his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">mother; and the change in her voice from despair to a kind
      of cheerfulness,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">showed what a mother's love can do. "Mother will come soon.
      Hide his face,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Anne, and wrap your shawl tight round him." And then her
      voice sank down</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">again in the same low, wild prayer for faith. Maggie could
      not turn to see</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">her face, but took the hand which hung near her. The woman
      clutched at it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with the grasp of a vice; but went on praying, as if
      unconscious. Just then</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the crowd gave way a little. The captain had said, that the
      women were to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">go next; but they were too frenzied to obey his directions,
      and now pressed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">backward and forward. The sailors, with mute, stern
      obedience, strove to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">follow out the captain's directions. Edward pulled Maggie,
      and she kept her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hold on the mother. The mate, at the head of the gangway,
      pushed him back.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Only women are to go!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There are men there."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Three, to manage the boat."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Come on, Maggie! while there's room for us," said he,
      unheeding. But</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie drew back, and put the mother's hand into the
      mate's. "Save her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">first!" said she. The woman did not know of anything, but
      that her children</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">were there; it was only in after days, and quiet hours,
      that she remembered</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the young creature who pushed her forward to join her
      fatherless children,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and, by losing her place in the crowd, was jostled--where,
      she did not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">know--but dreamed until her dying day. Edward pressed on,
      unaware that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie was not close behind him. He was deaf to reproaches;
      and, heedless</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the hand stretched out to hold him back, sprang toward
      the boat. The men</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">there pushed her off--full and more than full as she was;
      and overboard he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fell into the sullen heaving waters.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">His last shout had been on Maggie's name--a name she never
      thought to hear</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">again on earth, as she was pressed back, sick and
      suffocating. But suddenly</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">a voice rang out above all confused voices and moaning
      hungry waves, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">above the roaring fire.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, Maggie! My Maggie!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Out of the steerage side of the crowd a tall figure issued
      forth, begrimed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with smoke. She could not see, but she knew. As a tame bird
      flutters to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">human breast of its protector when affrighted by some
      mortal foe, so Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fluttered and cowered into his arms. And, for a moment,
      there was no more</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">terror or thought of danger in the hearts of those twain,
      but only infinite</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and absolute peace. She had no wonder how he came there: it
      was enough that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">he was there. He first thought of the destruction that was
      present with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">them. He was as calm and composed as if they sat beneath
      the thorn-tree</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on the still moorlands, far away. He took her, without a
      word, to the end</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">of the quarter-deck. He lashed her to a piece of spar. She
      never spoke:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie," he said, "my only chance is to throw you
      overboard. This spar</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">will keep you floating. At first, you will go down--deep,
      deep down. Keep</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">your mouth and eyes shut. I shall be there when you come
      up. By God's help,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I will struggle bravely for you."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She looked up; and by the flashing light he could see a
      trusting, loving</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">smile upon her face. And he smiled back at her; a grave,
      beautiful look,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">fit to wear on his face in heaven. He helped her to the
      side of the vessel,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">away from the falling burning pieces of mast. Then for a
      moment he paused.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"If--Maggie, I may be throwing you in to death." He put his
      hand before his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">eyes. The strong man lost courage. Then she spoke:</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I am not afraid; God is with us, whether we live or die!"
      She looked as</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">quiet and happy as a child on its mother's breast! and so
      before he lost</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heart again, he heaved her up, and threw her as far as he
      could over into</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the glaring, dizzying water; and straight leaped after her.
      She came up</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with an involuntary look of terror on her face; but when
      she saw him by the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">red glare of the burning ship, close by her side, she shut
      her eyes, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">looked as if peacefully going to sleep. He swam, guiding
      the spar.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I think we are near Llandudno. I know we have passed the
      little Ormes'</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">head." That was all he said; but she did net speak.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He swam out of the heat and fierce blaze of light into the
      quiet, dark</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">waters; and then into the moon's path. It might be half an
      hour before he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">got into that silver stream. When the beams fell down upon
      them he looked</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">at Maggie. Her head rested on the spar, quite still. He
      could not bear it.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie--dear heart! speak!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">With a great effort she was called back from the borders of
      death by that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">voice, and opened her filmy eyes, which looked abroad as if
      she could see</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">nothing nearer than the gleaming lights of Heaven. She let
      the lids fall</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">softly again. He was as if alone in the wide world with
      God.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"A quarter of an hour more and all is over," thought he.
      "The people at</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Llandudno must see our burning ship, and will come out in
      their boats."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">He kept in the line of light, although it did not lead him
      direct to the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">shore, in order that they might be seen. He swam with
      desperation. One</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">moment he thought he had heard her last gasp rattle through
      the rush of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the waters; and all strength was gone, and he lay on the
      waves as if he</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">himself must die, and go with her spirit straight through
      that purple lift</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to heaven; the next he heard the splash of oars, and raised
      himself</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and cried aloud. The boatmen took them in--and examined her
      by the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">lantern--and spoke in Welsh--and shook their heads. Frank
      threw himself on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">his knees, and prayed them to take her to land. They did
      not know his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">words, but they understood his prayer. He kissed her
      lips--he chafed her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">hands--he wrung the water out of her hair--he held her feet
      against his</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">warm breast.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"She is not dead," he kept saying to the men, as he saw
      their sorrowful,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pitying looks.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">The kind people at Llandudno had made ready their own
      humble beds, with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">every appliance of comfort they could think of, as soon as
      they understood</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the nature of the calamity which had befallen the ship on
      their coasts.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank walked, dripping, bareheaded, by the body of his
      Margaret, which was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">borne by some men along the rocky sloping shore.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"She is not dead!" he said. He stopped at the first house
      they came to. It</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">belonged to a kind-hearted woman. They laid Maggie in her
      bed, and got the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">village doctor to come and see her.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"There is life still," said he, gravely.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I knew it," said Frank. But it felled him to the ground.
      He sank first</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in prayer, and then in insensibility. The doctor did
      everything. All that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">night long he passed to and fro from house to house; for
      several had swum</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to Llandudno. Others, it was thought, had gone to
      Abergele.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">In the morning Frank was recovered enough to write to his
      father,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by Maggie's bedside. He sent the letter off to Conway by a
      little</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">bright-looking Welsh boy. Late in the afternoon she
      awoke.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">In a moment or two she looked eagerly round her, as if
      gathering in her</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">breath; and then she covered her head and sobbed.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Where is Edward?" asked she.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"We do not know," said Frank, gravely. "I have been round
      the village, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">seen every survivor here; he is not among them, but he may
      be at some other</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">place along the coast."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">She was silent, reading in his eyes his fears--his
      belief.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">At last she asked again.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I cannot understand it. My head is not clear. There are
      such rushing</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">noises in it. How came you there?" She shuddered
      involuntarily as she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">recalled the terrible where.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">For an instant he dreaded, for her sake, to recall the
      circumstances of the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">night before; but then he understood how her mind would
      dwell upon them</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">until she was satisfied.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"You remember writing to me, love, telling me all. I got
      your letter--I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">don't know how long ago--yesterday, I think. Yes! in the
      evening. You could</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not think, Maggie, I would let you go alone to America. I
      won't speak</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">against Edward, poor fellow! but we must both allow that he
      was not the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">person to watch over you as such a treasure should be
      watched over. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thought I would go with you. I hardly know if I meant to
      make myself known</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">to you all at once, for I had no wish to have much to do
      with your brother.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I see now that it was selfish in me. Well! there was
      nothing to be done,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">after receiving your letter, but to set off for Liverpool
      straight, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">join you. And after that decision was made, my spirits
      rose, for the old</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">talks about Canada and Australia came to my mind, and this
      seemed like a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">realization of them. Besides, Maggie, I suspected--I even
      suspect now--that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">my father had something to do with your going with
      Edward?"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Indeed, Frank!" said she, earnestly, "you are mistaken; I
      cannot tell you</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">all now; but he was so good and kind at last. He never
      urged me to go;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">though, I believe, he did tell me it would be the saving of
      Edward."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Don't agitate yourself, love. I trust there will be time
      enough, some</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">happy day at home, to tell me all. And till then, I will
      believe that my</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father did not in any way suggest this voyage. But you'll
      allow that,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">after all that has passed, it was not unnatural in me to
      suppose so. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">only told Middleton I was obliged to leave him by the next
      train. It was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not till I was fairly off, that I began to reckon up what
      money I had with</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">me. I doubt even if I was sorry to find it was so little. I
      should have to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">put forth my energies and fight my way, as I had often
      wanted to do. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remember, I thought how happy you and I would be, striving
      together as poor</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">people 'in that new world which is the old.' Then you had
      told me you were</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">going in the steerage; and that was all suitable to my
      desires for myself."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"It was Erminia's kindness that prevented our going there.
      She asked your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">father to take us cabin places unknown to me."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Did she? dear Erminia! it is just like her. I could almost
      laugh to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">remember the eagerness with which I doffed my signs of
      wealth, and put on</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">those of poverty. I sold my watch when I got into
      Liverpool--yesterday,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I believe--but it seems like months ago. And I rigged
      myself out at a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">slop-shop with suitable clothes for a steerage passenger.
      Maggie! you never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">told me the name of the vessel you were going to sail
      in!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I did not know it till I got to Liverpool. All Mr. Buxton
      said was, that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">some ship sailed on the 15th."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"I concluded it must be the Anna-Maria, (poor Anna-Maria!)
      and I had no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">time to lose. She had just heaved her anchor when I came on
      board. Don't</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you recollect a boat hailing her at the last moment? There
      were three of us</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">in her."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"No! I was below in my cabin--trying not to think," said
      she, coloring a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">little.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Well! as soon as I got on board it began to grow dark, or,
      perhaps, it was</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the fog on the river; at any rate, instead of being able to
      single out your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">figure at once, Maggie--it is one among a thousand--I had
      to go peering</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">into every woman's face; and many were below. I went
      between decks, and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by-and-by I was afraid I had mistaken the vessel; I sat
      down--I had no</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">spirit to stand; and every time the door opened I roused up
      and looked--but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">you never came. I was thinking what to do; whether to be
      put on shore in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Ireland, or to go on to New York, and wait for you
      there;--if was the worst</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">time of all, for I had nothing to do; and the suspense was
      horrible. I</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">might have known," said he, smiling, "my little Emperor of
      Russia was not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">one to be a steerage passenger."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But Maggie was too much shaken to smile; and the thought of
      Edward lay</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">heavy upon her mind.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Then the fire broke out; how, or why, I suppose will never
      be ascertained.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was at our end of the vessel. I thanked God, then, that
      you were not</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">there. The second mate wanted some one to go down with him
      to bring up the</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">gunpowder, and throw it overboard. I had nothing to do, and
      I went. We</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">wrapped it up in wet sails, but it was a ticklish piece of
      work, and took</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">time. When we had got it overboard, the flames were
      gathering far and wide.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">I don't remember what I did until I heard Edward's voice
      speaking your</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">name."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">It was decided that the next morning they should set off
      homeward, striving</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on their way to obtain tidings of Edward. Frank would have
      given his only</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">valuable, (his mother's diamond-guard, which he wore
      constantly,)as a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">pledge for some advance of money; but the kind Welsh people
      would not have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">it. They had not much spare cash, but what they had they
      readily lent to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the survivors of the Anna-Maria. Dressed in the homely
      country garb of</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the people, Frank and Maggie set off in their car. If was a
      clear, frosty</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">morning; the first that winter. The road soon lay high up
      on the cliffs</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">along the coast. They looked down on the sea rocking below.
      At every</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">village they stopped, and Frank inquired, and made the
      driver inquire in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Welsh; but no tidings gained they of Edward; though here
      and there Maggie</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">watched Frank into some cottage or other, going to see a
      dead body, beloved</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by some one: and when he came out, solemn and grave, their
      sad eyes met,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and she knew it was not he they sought, without needing
      words.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">At Abergele they stopped to rest; and because, being a
      larger place, it</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">would need a longer search, Maggie lay down on the sofa,
      for she was very</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">weak, and shut her eyes, and tried not to see forever and
      ever that mad</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">struggling crowd lighted by the red flames.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Frank came back in an hour or so; and soft behind
      him--laboriously treading</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">on tiptoe--Mr. Buxton followed. He was evidently choking
      down his sobs; but</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">when he saw the white wan figure of Maggie, he held out his
      arms.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My dear! my daughter!" he said, "God bless you!" He could
      not speak</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">more--he was fairly crying; but he put her hand in Frank's
      and kept holding</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">them both.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My father," said Frank, speaking in a husky voice, while
      his eyes filled</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">with tears, "had heard of it before he received my letter.
      I might have</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">known that the lighthouse signals would take it fast to
      Liverpool. I had</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">written a few lines to him saying I was going to you;
      happily they never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">reached--that was spared to my dear father."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Maggie saw the look of restored confidence that passed
      between father and</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">son.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"My mother?" said she at last.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"She is here," said they both at once, with sad
      solemnity.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Oh, where? Why did not you tell me?" exclaimed she,
      starting up. But their</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">faces told her why.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Edward is drowned--is dead," said she, reading their
      looks.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">There was no answer.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Let me go to my mother."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Maggie, she is with him. His body was washed ashore last
      night. My father</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and she heard of it as they came along. Can you bear to see
      her? She will</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">not leave him."</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"Take me to her," Maggie answered.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">They led her into a bed-room. Stretched on the bed lay
      Edward, but now so</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">full of hope and worldly plans.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Mrs. Browne looked round, and saw Maggie. She did not get
      up from her place</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">by his head; nor did she long avert her gaze from his poor
      face. But she</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">held Maggie's hand, as the girl knelt by her, and spoke to
      her in a hushed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">voice, undisturbed by tears. Her miserable heart could not
      find that</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">relief.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">"He is dead!--he is gone!--he will never come back again!
      If he had gone to</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">America--it might have been years first--but he would have
      come back to me.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">But now he will never come back again;--never--never!"</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Her voice died away, as the wailings of the night-wind die
      in the distance;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">and there was silence--silence more sad and hopeless than
      any passionate</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">words of grief.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">And to this day it is the same. She prizes her dead son
      more than a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thousand living daughters, happy and prosperous as is
      Maggie now--rich in</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">the love of many. If Maggie did not show such reverence to
      her mother's</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">faithful sorrows, others might wonder at her refusal to be
      comforted by</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">that sweet daughter. But Maggie treats her with such tender
      sympathy, never</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">thinking of herself or her own claims, that Frank, Erminia,
      Mr. Buxton,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Nancy, and all, are reverent and sympathizing too.</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">Over both old and young the memory of one who is dead
      broods like a</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">dove--of one who could do but little during her
      lifetime--who was doomed</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">only to "stand and wait"--who was meekly content to
      <i>be</i> gentle, holy,</p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText">patient, and undefiled--the memory of the invalid Mrs.
      Buxton.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
